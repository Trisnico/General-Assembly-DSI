59,ULPT Request: Noisy Upstairs Neighbor,"So, I have a VERY noisy upstairs neighbor. Pretty much every day from the moment I get home to the moment I go to sleep, all I can hear is this person clomping around, scraping furniture, slamming doors, and dropping stuff. It seems like it's purposefully ridiculous, that's the kind of noise I'm talking about. The floors are concrete with shitty insulation, so I expect some level of noise, but not like this. It's just plain ignorant and careless, if not purposeful and antagonistic. Not to mention, my girlfriend works nights and sleeps during the day. This asshole makes that very hard for her.

I made the mistake of making my first communication with them a rather rude letter that basically said, ""welcome to the building, now shut the fuck up."" Maybe I should've gone up there in person instead, but that's neither here nor there. I still haven't met them and I don't care to, because it almost seems like they're being loud on purpose now since that letter, and judging from the carelessness I have a suspicion that I'd be met with aggression or antagonism. Luckily, as far as I know, I'm also faceless to them because the apartment building is quite large (~150 apartments) so the faces you see could be anywhere in the building.

I also occasionally send the building manager an email to complain and ask for him to remind them to be quiet. Alas, I guess replying to my emails just isn't a service I get for my $1500 rent. He's totally unresponsive, so I have no idea if he's ever even asked them to keep it down. From the little snooping I've done, the upstairs neighbor seems to be a bit of the mouth-breathing type, so maybe even the manager (a smallish ~25 y/o guy) is afraid to say something to him.

How the heck can I get this guy to shut the fuck up? Or at least get at him in another way? The building is relatively modern and has cameras that would make things like shit-bagging impossible. Like I said, I don't care to confront him and I'd rather remain anonymous, but i just need some peace and fucking quiet or at least to feel like he's being inconvenienced or annoyed proportionally to what I have to put up with.

So I went on a date with a girl I met online about a year ago. At the time I didn't know her intentions but long story short it turns out she sets up multiple dates weekly to get guys to buy her dinner/ lunch then ghost them. Forward to ours and After a short and seamless date I'm ghosted completely after she ran up a huge tab of drinks and food. Nothing! 

I ran into her again on another site a few days ago...of course I have all new pics and she has NO clue we went on a date before. I didn't mention anything but I hinted at it and nothing. Anyways like clockwork she quickly suggest to go eat this week and that's she's free tues( tmrw). I agree and ask her to meet me at a very upscale and pricey sushi bar(valet only) in town and tell her to make sure she dresses up. I'm going to completely stand her up. Am I an asshole?

However, I need one in order to attempt to get a refund (&gt;$700) back for a nonrefundable hotel I can no longer go to. We (my partner and I) will be visiting a foreign country this year and travel plans unexpectedly changed, and we simply can't afford to get to the (relatively remote) location we had intended. Prices for transport have skyrocketed (it would be around $500 to get there), and frankly are just far sketchier than I initially believed. 

Anyway, I have decided to claim medical issues rather than personal issues, however they have requested proof of treatment or a doctor's note (I think, as their English isn't quite solid enough for me to comprehend completely). Does anyone have tips or know where I can get a believable template? This is the first trip I've ever planned and I've made a huge mistake, and I'm desperately hoping to be able to fix this. Thank you in advance for any advice you can offer.

891,ULPT: Woke up late after your shift at work? Here’s what you need to do....,"

1. Turn airplane mode on your phone. 

2. txt your boss that you’re going to be late for any reason 

3. hit send, and wait till your phone says “failed to send”.

4. Turn Airplane back mode on.

5. Snap a screenshot (#1)

Crucial steps: regarding date stamp in the text message app

6. Go to another text message inbox with someone you had previous discussion the night before or earlier in the day. 

7. Snap a screenshot of that message (screenshot #2)

9. Download an app that superimposes two images together. I used Superimpose app from the iPhone App Store. 

10. Lay screenshot #1 in the background and screenshot #2 in the foreground. 

11. Erase the image of screenshot #2 except the date-stamp and lay it on top of the “failed message” (screenshot #1) to replace that date-stamp.

11. Export 

12. Snap another screen shot of the export in full screen mode - just to be safe about the file extension. (This step is not necessary tho)

13. Send it to your boss explaining that your message didn’t go through the night before with final screenshot as proof. 

14. Escape the no-call no-show or write up. 

15. Profit

Edit: I have an iPhone and used Superimpose app to replace the date-stamp of the “failed” message. I’m not sure what Android has but there’s no doubt a similar app has been created. My excuse was that I was going to be late tomorrow morning because I noticed I had a flat and needed to go to the tire shop. It worked perfectly.

58,ULPT: Great way to get an immediate BIG upgrade at a upper-middle to luxury hotel.,"Book the cheapest room option. Checkin politely and nicely and maybe somewhat bubbly. It's probably also easier to pull with a significant other with you. 

When you get into the room, call down to the front desk, and embarrassingly, awkwardly, nicely, and with a small air of urgency or panic explain to them that you're....

 ""so so sorry to be the person to say this, but it...smells....as if someone may have JUST gone #2 in the bathroom. It's, like...overwhelmed the entire room and it's rather foul. I don't know, maybe one of the cleaners had an emergency? I'm sorry, I know this is weird and gross, but we don't know what to do, could we be moved to another room?"" 

Obviously if you're dealing with any hotel that has an element of top-notch customer service they are going to pounce on this and send someone up immediately with a new key - and to make up for this embarrassing issue, that key will open the door to a room several floors up and with a good bit more square-footage. 

I found this out because this actually did happen to me and my ex-bf, and afterwards it occurred to me how repeatable that would be. Because NO ONE is going to challenge you on it. It's not like a hotel rep is going to go up and walk around smelling and telling you they don't smell anything. And even if they DID, I mean, it does go away after a while, but it's still a gross way to first walk into a room.

134,ULPT-Request - How does one find a sympathetic and supportive doctor?,"I have a true and highly debilitating disability but I cannot even get a handicapped parking sticker. In fact I have MULTIPLE disabilities.

I live in an all-Mormon town where 35% of the people are polygamist FLDS with multiple wives and 65% are regular Mormons. I see BMW's and Mercedes parked outside the social security office and those are the kind of people who get benefits. A family that owns 33 bread and breakfasts is on welfare. Thirty three!! There are people who own million dollar homes on the mountain but they get government benefits. Because they know how to beat the system.

I am mostly uneducated and unemployed. I don't know how to beat the system. I could not get a handicapped parking sticker. But there are people who own pit bulls and other large dogs who get around the no-dog and no-pitbull requirements by classifying them as service dogs. They have sympathetic doctors in their Mormon wards and stakes who give them letters. There are girls in the sorority who keep pet dogs on campus because their doctor-friends give them fake service dog letters. There are football players and basket ball players who are 7 feet tall and 300 lbs and represent my university at all games and constantly win. But they have doctor-friends who give them fake letters and they collect disability payments. Just this morning a Mormon missionary who had recently returned from his mission told me how he gets extra time on his tests because his father's friend who is a doctor gave him a fake letter saying he had a disability or condition of some sort. 

In my case, a year ago my property management company forced me to put my labrador retriever down despite the service dog tag. They argued that the service dog school that trained and gave me the dog for free was in Canada - I am Canadian myself - and they wanted a service dog letter from a doctor in Utah itself. The dog pulls my wheelchair. You would think a local doctor will give me a letter right? But no, two different doctors turned me away saying no they don't give out those kinds of letters. But of course I had to pay them about $250 each even to see them. After paying them they said they don't give out such letters.

So my question is - how can I find a sympathetic doctor in my small town Utah when I belong to a different religion and a different race and a different country? I don't know anybody in Utah.

One mouse is newer and more expensive. I have receipts for both of these mice from my Best Buy, and recently purchased the newer more expensive one and am able to return it.

My question is, what are the real repercussions for just throwing the old model mouse into the new box and returning it for more money?

241,ULPT Request: Seeking revenge on our HORRIBLE roomate,"I live in a house with seven other people. One of our roommates is an all around AWFUL person. If we would have known how terrible this person is, we never would've allowed them to live with us in our house. Now we are looking for some ways to get back at our roommate for all the bullshit they've put us through. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll call our awful roommate AR just to keep it impersonal.

&amp;#x200B;

AR is the ultimate mooch. They don't have a job, and they have a criminal record, so its been hard for them to make money. AR's parents have cut them off (we are in college and most of our parents give us money when we need it--AR's parents don't). Any time any of us bring home food or leftovers, AR is instantly in your face asking for a bite or some fries or a sip of your drink. Sometimes AR doesn't even ask; example-- the other day my roommate brought home leftover chinese and by the next day AR had eaten it all, and when asked why AR just ate it they said ""it just looked good and I was hungry."" 

&amp;#x200B;

AR eats all of our groceries without asking. We've had eggs go missing, full boxes of poptarts and granola bars, entire packets of hot dogs and deli meat, and TONS of alcohol get taken by AR. It seems petty, but those kinds of items really add up in the long run. It's very disheartening after a long day and all you want to do is home home and eatyour delicious leftovers, and you find the container empty and in the garbage. 

&amp;#x200B;

AR also steals our clothes, jewelery, and makeup. This is where it gets really annoying. We have had t-shirts, jeans, pairs of shorts, lipstick, Fenty foundation and highlighter (which is a very VERY expensive brand of makeup one of my roommate's loves to purchase and wear), a Pandora charm bracelet, and numerous phone chargers and pairs of headphones. I can't count on one hand how many times I have gone to put something on in the morning, only to not be able to find it and then seeing AR wearing it later on in the day. We have asked her numerous times just to ask to borrow our stuff and we'll gladly let her borrow it but she continuously takes it and then KEEPS it after ""borrowing"" it. We all have to go up and search her room to find our clothing items. 

&amp;#x200B;

AR once brought home a stray animal that proceeded to pee and shit all over the house, then expected the rest of us to clean it up. Along with that AR wanted all of us to pitch in money to buy food and a vet visit for the animal. While all of us are huge animal lovers, we didn't want to deal with this stray mean little animal that was deystoying our home let alone pay for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently money has come up missing from multiple roommates. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of our roommates has a class with AR and recently AR asked the roommate to borrow their take-home exam to ""check over their \[AR's\] work"". Well AR just copied down our roommate's answers and they ended up getting in big trouble by their teacher for plagerism. AR ended up getting harsher repurcussions for that event, but has not learned a lesson whatsoever. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are plenty more instances of AR being a p.o.s. but for the sake of not writing a book I'll leave them out. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All of us roommates besides AR have spoken about these matters. We all know that AR is the one doing all of these things, we have all lived together before and have been friends for years; we would never do any of this shit without just asking the other. We don't have enough evidence to present to our school aboout AR's theivery to actually get them in trouble, but we are all so incedibly tired of dealing with this bullshit. We've tried talking to AR and getting things to change, but the bullshit just starts up again a few days after we have talked to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure the policies differ from campus to campus, but at my school, an organization with at least ~5 members potentially receives several hundred dollars of funding per quarter. This can completely be devoted to food at meetings. You could conceivably:

* Give the organization a professional/academic name, but ensure it is obscure enough that you could easily pretend you're doing work (i.e. ""Machine Learning Education Society"").
* Reserve meeting rooms.
* Get funded/reimbursed for all food expenses. At my school, it's $10 a person, which is perfect for a nice pizza/sandwich platter meal.
* Optional: spend 30 minutes on a website builder to make the club look a little more official.
* Don't market your club at all. You really don't want to exceed ~10 people.
* **Bonus ULPT:** Keep a schedule of all the other clubs throughout the day that offer food at their meetings. Make sure you don't need to do any work there either. Free food every day! 

You don't necessarily have to have it be an academic/professional club, but it's better not to have eyebrows raised at your ""Waifu Appreciation Coalition"".

Usually, the only work you'd need to put in is submitting the initial budget requests and reserving the rooms. As an added bonus, you could get free clothing as well!

By saying, (without being rude or sassy and totally politely)  ""you've done this for me before"" when asking for something unique from service people or staff, you'll become a lot more likely to succeed in your request.

The underlying implication is that a rule isn't being broken, since it's already been broken once in the past.

Example: at the airport 
Me: ""If there are any free rows, could I please move my seat to an empty row?
Check in attendant: ""Sorry sir we can't give you a row without you bidding on the adjacent seats. 
Me: ""oh I see, it's just that you've done this for me in the past."" 
Check-in attendant: ""ok I'll do for you this one time, but keep in mind that this is meant to be paid for.""

Corporate policies are flimisy barriers which staff and service people rarely care about. 

If they feel that you know that a rule is flexible, they'll be a lot more likely to bend that rule for you.

651,Phone repair workers of Reddit: how could I cause damage in my screen so warranty won't tell it's not intentional?,"I know this is an unethical question, but it's a very delicate issue:
I have purchased a Xiaomi Mi 8 a few weeks ago. I didn't buy a screen cover, because I literally never caused any scratches on my screen, or dropped the phone. For my biggest surprise, yesterday (after a long party) I seem to have severly scratched the screen. I knew that I f*cked up, so I looked for a repair company who does screen repairs on this device, but unfortunately no third party service centre offers this.

683,ULPT: Want to save a fuck ton of money on Textbooks in College? Abuse Amazon's Kindle Return Policy.,"Let me introduce you guys to what I call the Amazon Method. 

Basically all you have to do is:
1. Purchase the kindle version of the textbook you need from Amazon.com.
2. Load it up on a tablet or mobile device.
3. Take a screenshot of every page. (Using the swipe or button press shortcut)
4. Return the textbook within the return period and get your money back. (Typically 7 days)

This is similar to running a book through a scanner, but it's all digital and every page is perfect. Probably saved thousands of $$ by doing this. Lots of work but worth it if you're a cheap ass like me. Takes me about 30-40 minutes for a thousand page textbook. I'm only sharing this because I graduated from college already. Enjoy this while it lasts.

I want to print official-looking VIN tags for a car to replace on replaced body panels (NOT the official VIN plate in the window). The car should have 10 of them, but only has seven. Apparently this kills the re-sell value of the car, and I'd rather have it all intact for resale. 

I found a few companies that do this online, and even the shady looking ones say they'll only sell to a body shop.

901,ULPT Request: How to expose a person who’s expecting to destroy a family through an affair?,"Hi! Hopefully this community can help me out.

So, an ex friend in college basically fucked her way to the top of this small artistic startup that has a great reputation, etc. She’s the head animator and her (much, much older) boss is her lover. She knows his wife and children very well and the oldest child is going through some severe emotional pain and recently attempted suicide, and she (the child) is very dependent on her father for support.
Anyway, boss pays for all of ex friend’s stuff, pretty much blows a lot of family income on stuff for ex friend and lies to his wife and kids about why they aren’t having as big of a christmas this year, etc. According to her they have been planning for almost a year now to run away to California and relaunch their art company there, COMPLETELY abandoning the wife and kids, and live out the rest of their days in happiness or whatever. That last part is what hit me hardest, that they literally do not care about what happens to his family and that the boss feels no love for them anymore.
unfortunately for my ex friend she decided to trust me for some reason like a few weeks ago with all this information and hasn’t told another soul alive.
Now this person (ex friend) and I used to be good close friends but they really did me dirty recently. I’m not going to go into what they did to me because it’s not rly important.

TLDR; friend and her old man lover are lying and cheating and taking money from old man lover’s family and plan to abandon them in the very near future. I want to know how I can reasonably dash her chances of getting respected in the animation industry or at least knock her reputation down a few pegs around this college town’s art scene. Also, to ultimately expose this dude to his family so they can get their life together before shit hits the fan and they are left suddenly homeless or something because the wife is a stay at home mom. Because fuck that guy

117,ULPT: Spend Money You Don't Have in Your Checking Account Without NSF Fees,"This works best when you are a few days away from payday, but I know for a fact that it works because I've had to do it and figured this out after testing after inadvertently discovering this. Also, this may \*not\* work within the terms and conditions of certain financial institutions, so if you do try it, tread carefully at first with one transaction small enough that it would seem like a calculation error in your checking account reconciliation if it overdraws and you get the NSF fee. If your financial institution does then charge the NSF fee, try and have it reversed as a ""one-time courtesy"" as most FI's will do this for you if you don't have a history of overdrawing your account. This is also best when you don't need to spend much at all. 

**Here's the info**: If you need to buy a few things, and if you initially have the funds in your checking account for the highest transaction amount or highest dollar ticket item but would only be able to buy that one item, make sure the initial purchase is ""credit"" and not ""debit"" for that one item. Credit transactions - while being processed faster than they used to be in the past - still take a day or sometimes upwards of two days to actually clear your account. Debit transactions (performed by typing your PIN) clear your account immediately. This way, you've paid for the first item, but the funds are still in your account. Then, go and buy the other things you need while still choosing ""credit"" instead of ""debit"" so that they also don't clear immediately, but this is important: ***never exceed the amount you actually have in your account.*** 

Because the funds take a while to clear and get removed from your account, the authorization comes through for the subsequent purchases because all that the card readers check for is whether you have the funds in your account currently. They do *not* check for pending transactions. **Note:** this will of course end up drawing your account negative if all the transactions subsequently come through your account (hence why it's best to wait until just a couple days before payday), however you will not be charged an NSF fee for each transaction that ends up overdrawing your account because the purchases were previously authorized ""when you had the funds"" and were not declined at the Point of Sale.

Like I stated, this works for me when I'm in a pinch and need to get some stuff when I don't have the funds to cover it all. I've had $10 in my checking account and spent $50 with no NSF fees, simply because I kept all my transactions under the $10 I currently had in my account and received the approval for each one. 

I am also currently Opted Out of Regulation E, and I don't know if that makes a difference or not, but to be on the safe side you should contact for Financial Institution to ensure you are also opted out of Reg E or ""opt-in"" parameters.

148,"ULPT - Look up the ""handheld cell phone"" law in your state so you know what exceptions will get you out of a ticket for touching your phone while driving.","While many states have banned texting while driving, some now have blanket laws banning _all_ handheld cell phone use. However, most have an exception for calling 911 or otherwise reporting an emergency.

For example, here's Georgia's law:

    &gt; 149 (g) Subsections (c) and (d) of this Code section shall not apply when the prohibited
    &gt; 150 conduct occurred:
    &gt; 151 (1) While reporting a traffic accident, medical emergency, fire, an actual or potential
    &gt; 152 criminal or delinquent act, or road condition which causes an immediate and serious
    &gt; 153 traffic or safety hazard;

So, once you know what exceptions apply in your state, you'll know what to say to the officer who's about to write you a ticket for touching your phone! I recommend inventing something unverifiable, like ""A truck went by going the other direction with an unsecured ladder that was about to fall off and cause an accident, so I was calling to report it."".

Anywho, messed up a lot as a younger lad, never really cared about money too much and hence a career...now I'm pushing 30 and have nothing going on except shit jobs.

Read a r/offmychest post about some hiring manager that completely made up a fake resume for a VP position, got the job, made millions (maybe bullshit, maybe not). Got me thinking about the legitimacy of it all and the possibility of just ""faking it til you make it""!

So, I'm a fairly intelligent person and with that in mind I'm thinking of doing the same thing. Fake references to real people (i.e. phone numbers), bullshit everything else...what's it matter? No, I didn't work at a burger joint for two years 6 months ago, I've been the lead IT consultant at a private company the past 8 years. That sort of thing.

Question is this...what are some really good jobs that someone could theoretically do with ZERO experience that actually pay WELL, talking $50-60K or more a year. Ya know nothing outrageous but COMFORTABLE? More is better of course if the job is doable.

Talked to a friend and he also reminded me of looking for something that doesn't require licenses (dead give away when they ask) and PREFERABLY doesn't require a degree (a lot probably won't ask, some will?) but I can just fake this too.

I figure if I can get the job done at the end of the day and no one catches on then I realllly don't see the problem in doing this.

Recently, this really amazing opportunity came up for me, but unfortunately I was scheduled to work that day. I called off work at the last minute for tomorrow, and claimed family emergency. (I couldn't say sick because I was at work well today). 
I was told that someone would be in touch with me next week and that I might have to provide proof of whatever it is. 
This job isn't what I want to do for a career, but I'd prefer to remain in okay standing if possible because it is decent money, and usually flexible enough so that I can devote time to my creative ventures and what I really am trying to achieve in life. 
Was wondering if anyone could give me any help or advice regarding coming up with proof of my 'family emergency', or how I could fake some proof. I didn't say anything else beyond family emergency, so anything I could easily fake proof for works!

311,"ULPT: If you're in a flame war, don't try and think of smart put-downs, just go really dumb. There's nothing more frustrating that arguing against someone who's too stupid to realize your put-down was clever.","The problem with flame wars is that you're reliant on the other person understanding why what you just said is a clever put-down.  Play in to this, and act too stupid to get it.  This leaves them powerless.  It's also universally grating to argue with someone who's too stupid to realize what a moron they are.

Examples of when I've done this, over voice comms in video games (context, I'm British, and sound British):

One time I got in to an argument with a guy who had a southern US accent.  I kept calling him a ""yankee"", and when he told me he was a southerner, I pretended I thought he meant he was from South America, and kept calling him a commie liberal.  There was nothing he could do with that level of stupid.

Another time my ~~vict~~ ""debate partner"" was Canadian.  When I called him an American, he was outraged.  I convinced him I thought Canada was a state in the US, and when he tried to tell me it was a separate country I accused him of ""just splitting hairs"".

Key factors:

1.  You've really got to convince them you're that dumb, don't let them realize it's an act.

2.  Just babbling discontinuous nonsense while they're trying to speak (if in voice), or radically changing the subject to 12 year old nonsense is very frustrating, and can often bring them down to your level.  Knowing that your partner can't even hear you is incredibly annoying.

3.  Exude a massive amount of unearned confidence and extreme satisfaction in your own bullshit.  This one is the most important.  You can't relent.  Think of the adage ""Arguing with a moron is like playing chess with a pigeon - no matter how clever your stratagem, the pigeon is just going to crap on the board and prance around like he won"".",UnethicalLifeProTips,1537802827,Freeloading_Sponger,487,13653,True,2018-09-24

Nothing has happened to him legal-wise, he owes her $5,000 for her paying for things and he said he’d repay her. My friend is depressed, and can’t believe she didn’t see his true colors until now. I know she’s too much of a sweetheart to do anything, but I’m not. What’s the best way to legally fuck with him? I have his Discord and Twitch account names, pretty sure I could do something with that. All he cares about is gaming, so if I fucked that up somehow, that’d be perfect. I know this seems immature, but the amount of abuse and the state of shock and hurt he left her in is unreal. All for him to be living at home with mommy and daddy a week later sitting on his ass all day getting high? That’s not right at all.

Did this when I was unemployed. Got me so many interviews and finally a job. Here are the basic steps:

1. Create a fake LinkedIn account of someone who is as successful as possible. Make sure the information is hard to verify (large companies, non public role) and correct (for example MIT issues S.B instead of B.S.). Mine was double major MIT engineering summa cum laude and Stanford PhD with every internship under the sun and working at Google.
2. Set you LinkedIn job interests to ""actively searching"", put the areas you want to work, and check the button that lets recruiters search for you.
3. Within 24 hours the recruiters will be fighting over you like a bunch of thirsty guys on Tinder. Do what girls do and string them along to get them more and more desperate.
4. If you see a job you like invent an excuse and recommend ""a friend"" (you).

588,ULPT Look better with your shirt off while committing tax fraud!,"Preface:
Two general guidelines with cheating on your taxes are don’t get greedy and if you get caught, plea ignorance.

Description of ILPT:
The prescribed plan is for those who can lie, want to look better with their shirt off, want to deduct food expenses, and want to create a business to funnel other expenses through for tax benefits.

ILPT:
You want to look good and pick up some extra cash, so you set your sights on the world of professional bodybuilding. As an aspiring professional bodybuilder (and filing as an individual and not under any legal entity like an LLC), you can get away with deducting your lifting equipment and your gym membership from your income, but you can’t deduct the shorts you wear at the gym or the food you eat because you can use those shorts can be used other things and the food you eat is arguably not specific enough (more importantly, you don’t have any credibility in the eyes of the IRS yet); whereas lifting equipment and gym membership are VERY specific to your income (ie you can’t use lifting equipment anywhere else, and you need a gym to build your body). However, if you form a business, you can get more creative.

Now, if you were to start an LLC (legal expense), recruit a few clients (service revenue and sales expense), go to a few shows (research expense), create a website and Instagram account promoting your business (marketing expense), and establish a home office (you must prepare the food and conduct business in the same place), then the as long as you “prepared” the food at home during your business hours for yourself—the sole employee— then you are perfectly allowed to deduct 100% of those food expenses. To the IRS, you’re a hustling entrepreneur who works an unconventional schedule to service your clients 24/7.

Congratulations, you’re now avoiding taxes by funneling expenses through an illegal shell company! 

Epilogue:
But, you’re a professional bodybuilder in the eyes of the IRS, so if you’re gonna sell the story, you’d better buy (and this is critical) BUSINESS-SPECIFIC foods and supplements “for you and your clients.” Unfortunately, you can’t be charging Pizza Hut and McDonald’s to your company all that often, especially if you don’t look good with your shirt off. You don’t want to attract unnecessary attention and go to jail for tax fraud!

610,"ULPT Commit tax fraud by creating a shell company to buy things you want as business expenses, as business expenses are tax deductible.","Preface:
Two general guidelines with cheating on your taxes
1. Don’t get greedy.
2. if you get caught, plea ignorance.

Description of ILPT:
The prescribed plan is for those who can lie, want to look better with on beach days, want to deduct food expenses, and want to create a business to funnel other expenses through for tax benefits.

ILPT:
You want to look good and pick up some extra cash, so you set your sights on the world of professional bodybuilding. As an aspiring professional bodybuilder (and filing as an individual and not under any legal entity like an LLC), you can get away with deducting your lifting equipment and your gym membership from your income, but you can’t deduct the shorts you wear at the gym or the food you eat because you can use those shorts for other things and the food you eat is arguably not specific enough (more importantly, you don’t have any credibility in the eyes of the IRS yet); whereas lifting equipment and gym membership are VERY specific to your income (ie you can’t use lifting equipment anywhere else, and you need a gym to build your body). However, if you form a business, you can get more creative.

Now, if you were to start an LLC (legal expense), recruit a few clients (service revenue and sales expense), go to a few shows (research expense), create a website and Instagram account promoting your business (marketing expense), and establish a home office (you must prepare the food and conduct business in the same place), then the as long as you “prepared” the food at home during your business hours for yourself—the sole employee— then you are perfectly allowed to deduct 100% of those food expenses. To the IRS, you’re a hustling entrepreneur who works an unconventional schedule to service your clients 24/7.

Congratulations, you’re now avoiding taxes by funneling expenses through an illegal shell company! 

Epilogue:
But, you’re a professional bodybuilder in the eyes of the IRS, so if you’re gonna sell the story, you’d better buy (and this is critical) BUSINESS-SPECIFIC foods and supplements “for you and your clients.” Unfortunately, you can’t be charging Pizza Hut and McDonald’s to your company all that often, especially if you don’t look good with your shirt off (yet). You don’t want to attract unnecessary attention and go to jail for tax fraud!

618,ULPT Request: Random guy gave Tesla my phone number to pick up a Model 3. Should I give it a test run?,"Hey guys. So I had recently got a new phone number for my new job about 6 months ago. When I got the new phone, I was immediately bombarded with texts and messages from random people, all of them asking for a certain ""Trevor"". I knew that this must have been a recycled number that was previously owned by this Trevor guy.  
  
At first, I was a bit annoyed and after trying for hours to get my carrier to change my number (it's a corporate number, very bureaucratic), I just gave up and decided to live with it. I eventually ended up having fun with it, posing as Trevor. I would respond to birthday texts, group texts, voicemails for expiring gym memberships and requests to return electronics. I think this person might be some type of con-artist but I digress.  
  
Anyway, today I think I hit the jackpot. I just received a voicemail for a guy named Mike from Tesla, saying ""Hi Trevor, just wanted to let you know, I have your reservation for your Model 3. We are currently test driving it. Please call back whenever you can to schedule when you can have your test drive and have you pick it up.""  
  
I think all the other times I posed as Trevor has been training me for this moment. Should I call back and have some fun with it? Any upsides/downsides? Any advice or ideas? What should I expect if I go through with it? I honestly just want to see if I can get away with just test driving it, I don't plan on actually stealing it.

I have this advertising exec, who I know from college.  One day, we were planning to meet up, but he was running late on one of his photoshoots.  He said I could swing by while they wrapped up.  So I did, and I was introduced to this very attractive model on set.  We chatted for a bit, and I eventually got her number.  The next day, we had a date and a great time.

Normally, I would never get the opportunity to be in front of a model, let alone talk to her.  But the photoshoot was the perfect chance to do so.  So I reached out to my college friend, and gave him a BS excuse to set up another shoot with another model.  He did, and I was on set the entire time.  I used that time together to chat up the model, flirt, exchange numbers.  The next thing you know, we're together.

Although creepy, for me, it's so much more successful than PMing a model or trying to pick up a woman at a bar.  On set, I'm not a creepy guy, taking random pics of her.  I'm just being social, flirty, etc...   It's less time wasted too.  You have exclusive time with the model, and can direct your time/energy into her.

938,ULPT Request: How do I avoid inviting certain people over for a dinner?,"This is gonna be a long story, so skip to TL;DR if you'd like.

I've been cooking a lot as a hobby as of recent, and decided that I should bring my friends over for a dinner to show off my cooking a bit.

I'm planning on making a very luxurious dish, which will cost me a lot in raw materials. I can manage a certain amount, but if too many people come I'll simply be unable to pay for it.

The thing is, I'm looking at around 11 people, including myself, when 9 people is ideal considering the portion size. Coincidentally, out of those 11 people, there are 2 people, let's call them A and B, who I would not like to invite; not just because of the expense, but because I just don't like them in general.

However, the problem is that A is C's brother, B is D's brother, and C and D are very nice guys who I have been meaning to catch up with for a while. So I would like to have C and D over for the dinner, but it'll be hard for me to not invite A and B without causing some drama.

If A and B were just mutual friends, I'd be fine with just telling C and D that I don't really like them, but I feel like since they're blood related they won't take that news very well.

What could I do? I just want to have a nice meal with some guys, but don't want to have to spend unreasonably because I have to pay for guys I don't even like.

**TL;DR: Planning a dinner for 10 of my friends, but financially I can only afford to have 8 over. Would like to not invite 2 of the guys from the original 10, but it's hard to do so, because those 2 guys are thr brothers of the guys I'd actually like to invite.

We work in a small store and it is just the two of us so when one of us has the day off the other one is working alone.

Method #2 
Call your local McDonald's and tell them you just got home and noticed you were missing ""X"" and ask if you could come get back to get one. Tell them your name and ask for the employee's name too and tell them that you will be there in ""X"" minutes. Then walk up to the counter, ask for employe you talked on phone and tell them the item you said before and your name, boom.

Basically read the t&amp;c carefully, if it looks like a loophole it probably is. They intentionally write them with casual language so the customer is right more often then not.

If your clever and you ask the reps the right questions you should be able to figure them out for yourself.  But here is two for free:

1. The 90 day return policy is limited by weight and size. If you buy something over the limit they won’t make you send it back. You get a refund and you get to keep the thing.

2. Benefits stack if you multiple cards. Unless the t&amp;c explicitly state you have to pay for the item entirely on one card you can split the payment and stack the benefits. 
- example: If you’re careful you can use the price  guarantee to buy expensive things practically for free. If you split it right and find a good ad.

There are a few ways to make money, but be careful because if you make it to obvious they’ll cut you off.

In short BE NICE TO THE REPS!!! They get enough shit, if your nice to them they’ll bend the rules a bit. Maybe they’ll take an ad that isn’t exactly legit, maybe they’ll argue with the adjuster on your behalf, etc. JUST BE KIND!

This works in most amusement parks, and in some there is often a long complaint line on the way out where they’ll just hand out tickets without even asking for what happened because they would rather give a few people free admission than lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in a lawsuit.

If you buy something because of the coupon deal, you are wasting money as you didn't need it until you saw the coupon.

The cool thing about these apps is that you can retroactively log purchases to get rewards. This allows me to not get distracted into buying stupid shit because I log my purchases after the fact.

This loophole also has another benefit. You can use receipts from other people. A month ago, I was at the self-checkout at walmart when I accidentally knocked over the little trash can next to the register. Out fell 12 crumpled up receipts that other people had thrown away. I snagged them all up and took them home. Between the handful of apps that I have, I was able to get back almost three dollars of cash back. Now every time I go to walmart, I grab a handful of receipts that people have thrown away. Iknow it doesn't sound like much, but it all adds up, and I get the rewards without buying any shit that I wasn't already going to buy.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1532383942,Larktheshark81,20,127,True,2018-07-23

132,"ULPT: Tell him / her you want an ""open relationship"" instead of dumping them.","I'm writing a character in a dnd campaign and one of the themes is psychological distress. I want this character's behavior to tire you. Anyway, below is an outline of my character's lines of thinking in the end of a long term relationship.

Here's why you should open that relationship up:

(1) The initial period after the announcement, if they agree to stick around, they'll recognize your shift toward going out more is part of this new ""thing"" and feel more pigeonholed into accepting it. In their minds they got off lucky not getting dumped; they shouldn't complain because at least they still ""have"" you. So you can still do exactly what you want. Say you need time and space.

(2) They will be way more patient and weak on arguments as you've rotted down their psyche to the point where they'll avoid argument for fear of losing up. They will be more inclined to fix arguments and make you feel better.

(3) If you're a jealous cunt, don't worry, he / she is probably so emotionally distraught they can't even fathom seeing anyone else. They want you, and you're free to basically want who you want. They'll crave your attention and count it a blessing.

(4) If in time you realize the breakup was a bad idea, you can dramatically have a ""surprisingly"" romantic date with them, and stage a theater production about how you fell in love again. From here, you can make the relationship closed again. They absolutely will not object as this will feel as they've been given medicine by you, their poison. 

(5)Also, if you did a true breakup, they get the leverage of acting hurt while proud that you came ""crawling back."" Rob them of this sense of power. String them along and underinvest emotionally. Edge them on love, and then you decide when to turn up the gas. Now they'll feel lucky, like you're a god / goddess that gave them a second chance.

Basically, avoid making any commitments that people aren't compelling you to make. Do the bare minimum to preserve the health and dignity of your fellow human beings, and you'll come out the strongest.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1532402086,eadala,17,42,True,2018-07-23

Let's say there's someone in your class you want to get closer to. Send them a seemingly random email linking them to an 'anonymous' Google survey.

185,ULPT ChanGe Friends WIFI! hack ComCast router for fun!,"The next time you’re at a friends house who has Comcast Xfinity Wireless internet, simply log onto their routers website. The default router IP Address for the Xfinity Router—or any router, for that matter—is usually ""192.168.1.1"", “192.168.100.1” or “10.1.10.1”.  Most likely it’s the 10.1.10.1 

If your friend is smart they will already have changed the router password, but most people forget about that and just continue to use the default login. Here is what to do next. Most routers use default login credentials. The most usual username/password combination would be “admin” for your username, and “password” for the password.

Other possible combinations would be “root” and “root”, or “cusadmin” and “highspeed”. If that doesn’t work, and it’s not on the box or the router, well, you just have to check the manual.

Once logged in to your router you need to go to the page that allows you to edit your wireless network. From the left-hand sidebar, you should go to ‘Gateway’- ‘Connection’- ‘Wifi’ and then click on edit wireless network.

From this page, you can enter a new wireless password. Make sure you choose a strong, easy to remember password. If you aren’t sure if you will remember the password or not, perhaps it would be a good idea to make a note of your new password after entering it.

Once you are happy with your password, make sure to click the save settings button to save your new password.

No I have not asked them to not park there because they are white trash, and honestly probably don't care. I am going to get another car of mine to park in front, but the issue is you can squeeze 3 cars in the space if need be, so between my 2 cars,  if they try to squeeze in, then I will say something. At first I thought they were just doing it for convenience, but they make it a point to park on my side. They have plenty of parking in front of their house and a drive way and a large garage, I'm not trying to be a dick or anything, but they are really pissing me off.

Gender doesn't matter. You can use the child's name or make one up. How you manage that is up to you.  Now you need a dog, a larger, non-threatening breed like  a collie or golden retriever.

That's, I don't know, 20 cups instead of 3 or 4 if I went to a coffee shop but it's still expensive. My local store has a self-service station for buying as much coffee bean as you want and you write the ID number down on the package. Obviously I'm going to choose the $8 bean ID number and get myself the good coffee that I prefer.

Similarly, I like pine nuts but are you kidding me at $20/lb?! Soy nuts look similar and they're $3/lb - I know which ID number I'm choosing.

Today I saved $12 on coffee and pine nuts. Eventually they'll figure out the coffee inventory situation because I do that once a week, but pine nuts I think i can scam for a long time.

TL;DR first of all, it's not too long so now I'm going to waste your time. Secondly, ok now it's time. When buying bulk items at grocery, use ID numbers of similar looking items that cost much less.",UnethicalLifeProTips,1532997680,CheapCup,3,1,True,2018-07-30

851,"ULPT: If you have a need for speed, buy a ""Great"" radar detector. The lack of tickets and points will thank you later.","When you walk into a store and make a selection, generally there are plenty of options, but it generally falls into four categories.

This shit is made in China, it's ok, it's good, it's awesome.

When you see a radar detector for $99, or $199, you are somewhere between it's made in china shit, or it's ok.

Once you bump past the $400 dollar mark, you have a GPS enabled device that allows it to memorize false alarms (usually you have to go past the same point two or three times, and it will remember that it was bullshit. So on your regular commute, after a few trips you know if it goes off, there is a radar gun somewhere close by).

You are also able to upload/download updates which marks things like red light cameras, speed traps, things of that nature.

Also allows you to connect to your smartphone and pass real time information to other drivers as well.

Sure, it doesn't work against laser; if you get pinged by laser it is an instant hit. You can purchase devices that scramble a laser radar, but generally the source knows it is being scrambled, and I believe in many states it is illegal, so best to stay away from that (or keep it on until you get a laser ping, then turn it off. The source see's it as an error code).

Stationary radar detectors to show your speed also set it off. It doesn't seem to remember those; perhaps they are too close to the real thing as apposed to say a convenience store.

It will pay itself off in two or three averted tickets.

Bonus points, mount it to your rear view mirror. Gets much better detection.

Generally if a cop has his radar detector on, I can spot it from at least a mile away. I've had it blow up constantly saying a bunch of radar is up ahead; it's generally an accident, and a bunch of cruisers on the side of the road.

974,"ULPT: If you're trying to sneakily smoke weed out the window of your room, consider the air currents.","   Hot air rises and will make its way above colder air.  With that in mind, the temperature of the air outside compared to the air inside will affect the air currents floating through your window.  If it's warmer outside than inside, blow your smoke out the bottom of the window.  Contrary, if it's colder outside than inside, blow your smoke out the top.  This alone can make a significant difference in what aroma lingers in the room.*extra tip on the house*   Since we're talking air currents, try to minimize any airflow between your room and the rest of the house.  Everyone knows the cliché towel under the door, but many forget about the air ducts.  Cover up those vents, only take a hit that you can fully inhale with no excess smoke trailing out, and use a sploof (doob tube, smoke buddy, fabric softener stuffed toilet paper roll, whatever you might call it).
