100,Boss at work is a douchebag,"I am a college student with a work study job. We only work 8 hours a week. 

I have had a supervisor for the last two years at my work study. He was hired two years into my college career. I have been there four years. My boss loves me, and so does the chief head of the department I am in. All the staff love me. I have never had a bad experience in the department with the other staff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met my supervisor and he seemed nice. We got to know each other in the workplace, and we actually started keeping in touch outside of work as well. Last December, he took me to the college he used to work at and we walked around and saw the Christmas lights. He took me out to sushi for my 21st birthday too before I went home for the holidays ( I am 2.5 hours away from home when I am at school ). He and I gained a really nice friendship and I gave him advice on a girl he really liked. He and I did get into slight sexual talk, and he asked me if I would ever have sex with him and I said I wasn't sure.

After a little while our friendship grew distant. We stopped texting every day. I thought it was mostly because we were busy etc. Over the course of the last two semesters, he has just turned into an absolute asshole. He has been trying to make me look stupid in the workplace, giving me more work to do than my fellow work study students, telling me to do one thing and getting mad if I do it and telling me he wanted something else. Work studies are supposed to allow me to study a bit while I work and now every time I work I have to do projects for him that other students aren't involved in. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last 4 years I always call the specific person in the department that specializes in an issue to resolve a problem someone contacts me for. (that's what I'm supposed to do... always have) and one day I called a specific person for help and my supervisor came FLYING around the corner saying ""NO! YOU DON'T CALL THEM FOR THAT YOU CALL ME!!!"" and stomped off. There have been times he's made me almost cry because he stresses me out and is a dick to me.

I've seriously never had an issue like this before and I don't know what to do. He smiles at everyone else and has a great attitude but with me he doesn't even have an average look on his face. he just looks angry with me. I told my boss I felt like he was having issues with me and my boss said he would take care of it. Since then it's only gotten worse. What do I do???

163,LPT: Fun method for learning languages... comic books + translator.,"I am making fast progress with German this way. Before I used to focus solely on just learning the grammar. It bored me every time and I gave up after multiple attempts. However, I came to realize the power of repetition and context. Simply finding a comic book I enjoyed and using Google Translate made wonders for me. Repeating the translations of the words, coupled with the images on screen really does wonders. Later I found a better website for translating I switched to, I will link it in the steps. Alright, so here's the method:

**Step 1:** Find a comic book in the foreign language that looks like you would enjoy reading it. For me it was ""Die Chronik der Unsterblichen"". If you need a place to find comic books that are in German send me a pm.

**Step 2:** Download a comic book reader, I recommend CDisplayEx.

**Step 3:** Open the comic book, and in your browser open up Google Translate or even better, the translator which I am using now [https://www.deepl.com](https://www.deepl.com/) it is ALOT better and can handle context MUCH better.

Just go through the comic book, the point here is not focusing on the rules and grammar of each sentence and word, it is to learn the words through **repetition** and **context**. Anyway, it is really hard at the beginning if you are new learner of the language, but it gets easier and easier the more you progress into the comic book. I am still new with the language, but I am progressing way faster and can actually comprehend and read a lot of sentences now.

Also, I am not sure if this method will work with languages with hard pronunciation rules, but should be the same. Good luck!",LifeProTips,1542672789,Momchilo,14,1,True,2018-11-19

194,LPT: Learn to hug,"When I was a teenager, my older sister took a second once to correct how I hugged her. It stuck with me and really kind of boosted my confidence to be able to give a sturdy hug.

Years later and after I got married, my wife and I were visiting her family around the holidays and her younger sister gave me an awkward hug. I said ""let's try that again"" and took a second to show her where to put her arms and told where I was going to put mine. After that whenever we saw her she would give good hugs.

It seems small but I'm glad I did it, because that sister passed away in a car accident earlier this year. The holidays have us all thinking about her, and I'm seeing now how teaching her to hug is actually a really special memory for me. These holidays are going to be hard, especially for my wife and in-laws. She was only 25, and had so much in front of her.

You may have to hug people in different ways, but it's worth it to work through the awkwardness. Avoid half-hearted hugs, side hugs, and stiff hugs. It's possible to give a good one-armed hug, but only if you'd be able to give that person a good normal hug. If you're not willing to commit to a hug it'll probably be awkward.

Sometimes a good hug can communicate better than words, and can make a huge impact. It's worth it to learn how to hug confidently.",LifeProTips,1542684582,rseay,19,1,True,2018-11-19

To avoid being reminded of them every time you listen to your favourite music, visit a favourite place, read a favourite book, watch a favourite movie, drink a favourite drink, or eat a favourite food, simply don't share them with your partner. 

Always profess to like what they like, and even go so far as to steer them away from things you actually like. Instead, indulge in these things during your ""alone time"".

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*1.4k points · 7 hours ago  
They   have extremely strict gun laws, and most states around aren't as   strict. So you can legally have a gun in your state but if you go into   NY it may not be legal anymore and you can be arrested, possible jail   time and can be quite costly.

Rent a [safe deposit box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_deposit_box)  from either a bank or post office. They are mobile and you can, on  request, leave the premises with them. Same rules apply if the box is on  you in your car  i.e : ""They \[also\] may be searched and seized by the  order of a court through the issuance of search warrant."" only.

345,LPT REQUEST: How to not lose discipline and motivation for studying.,"Hey guys.

I'm coming with a (probably) typical request, but I'm honestly weirded out by how my brain works and I feel like an outside perspective or perhaps advice would be of huge impact.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks ago I've decided to learn programming and pursue a career in the industry.

I'm coming with a solid foundation of an idea how to create a routine and be systematic because of my workout and nutrition routines that I've been following religiously. I wanted to stop wasting my time for pointless entertainment and devote my evenings to study coding.

I've bought a book, put on binary waves for concentration and off I went to studying.

For the first week the effects were astounding. I've learned the majority of HTML, which isn't that hard in fact, but it made me realize that if I keep going like this I'll slowly but surely make my dreams come true. During that first week I really felt like I'm living. No more games, movies, wasting time. I woke up, went to training, then spent 6 hours applying for jobs and crafting the perfect resume and motivational letters, then from 5pm to 11pm I studied. I even found an absolutely amazing mentor who patiently and eagerly answered each and every question I asked and we agreed to make it a routine to go over my notes together after each of my daily sessions.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly was baffled and so proud of myself that I finally was moving in the right direction, as I said, no more wasting time, I finally felt like I'm living.

&amp;#x200B;

And then... I felt like I'm burning out. I started feeling tired, my back hurt from sitting at the computer (or so I was telling myself) and suddenly the idea of taking a break and watch a movie started becoming nicer and nicer, until the day came where I didn't even open the book anymore, just lied down on my bed and watched movies. My room started becoming a mess and I felt more and more burned out, telling myself I'll come back to studying and that I just need a little break, that it was too much to handle at first and I need to get myself used to the routine, gradually shortening the eventual breaks I would take.

Well, yesterday I looked around at my room and it was a total mess, all I felt like doing was slack around on my bed, scrolling and watching stuff on my phone. I started falling into depression and self-hatred again.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I woke up, put on some inspirational music, cleaned the entire house, did the laundry, my room is perfectly clean and everything is in nice tidy order but I still don't feel the same thrill and motivation to study. It's like I can't find it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if you got any idea what I could do... I know it's really up to me telling myself ""Dude what the fuck are you doing?"" but it's like I'm lost again. Do you have any similar experiences? What would be some nice techniques to stay on point? Please help, I miss that feeling of excitement and progress and it feels like I'm trapped in this lazy state again.",LifeProTips,1542746278,VividStill,5,1,True,2018-11-20

My laptop was so dirty that I could see the dandruff between the keys (sorry, TMI).

The keys are pristine. It took about 10 minutes to clean mine but if you don't suffer from a skin condition it would likely take a couple minutes. What I did was just --

1. Hold laptop upside down with one hand

2. Rub the keyboard back and forth with the brush in the other hand, almost like you'd clean a dish, which allows the bristles to dislodge the dirt and gunk and then gravity to do the rest.

3. Tap on the keyboards like you were doing a typing test or playing a mean game of QWOP. 

4. Repeat *2* and *3*, dislodging and tapping out the dirt until your soul feels clean looking at your keyboard.

I turn the plugin off when I really need to go to one of those sites, or have it disabled in incognito mode forcing me to re-login if i really want to use a site - which is always a pain and discourages usage.

I didnt have the money, nor the time to get it fixed with a 40% POP the next day i chanced my luck and got fucked. Luckily, while in the crowd for Kanye West, i was telling a random that i had struck up a convo with about my issue and he told me to get rain-x, he swore me it would fix my problem, like he swore up and down that i was gonna be flawlessly driving home... And sure enough that fuckin dude was right and i wish i had a way of thanking him, we backstreeted out way to a pep boys and got Rain x, and applied it under the canopy of a shut down gas station. It requires you to spray the window, and then essentially wax on wax off it into your window. On the day i applied it, the second i hit about 15 km/h (like 7 MPH) the water just flew off my car. it was amazing and i honestly sometimes thing i like it better than a windshield wiper.

725,"LPT: If you are trying to teach your children to behave, you must never, ever give in to them and give them what they want when they complain or cause a scene. If you sometimes capitulate to them, it is literally worse than ALWAYS capitulating.","This is a basic psychological concept of training that it is clear most people are unaware of. If your child misbehaves because they want something you will not give them, you absolutely must not ever give in to them. If you give in to them sometimes, it teaches them that it is possible to get what they want by being bad. Now, that seems obvious, but here is the important part.

When you give in sometimes and stand firm sometimes, it not only trains them in the wrong habits, it makes it nearly impossible to train them in the right habits. It is easier to retrain someone who has never been properly disciplined than someone who is properly disciplined some of the time. If a child is never properly disciplined and then is put into a new situation where they are being regularly disciplined there is a clear delineation and the child can learn new behavior. HOWEVER, if a child is only disciplined sometimes, even if you change to constant discipline they will remember (both consciously and subconsciously) that just because they didn't get what they want this time does not mean that they can't get it next time with bad behavior. Therefore, it takes an incredible amount of effort to retrain someone when you have been inconsistent with discipline.

Please note, I KNOW it is hard to tell your child no sometimes when you are in a public place and they are throwing a tantrum and you just want to get your groceries and get home, but if you give them that candy you told them they couldn't have you are literally damaging their growth as a good person AND making your life harder and worse in the long run.

This can work in almost every scenario, not only when helping people carry things. Imagine a coworker is extremely overloaded with work and you can help them.

To avoid impulsive buying, before  such events I make a list with the things that I really need and things  that I really wish for. The difference is that those that I wish for  will get into my shopping bag only if they have a really good discount.  Something that can't be found thought the year.

To avoid spending hours searching through the thousands of offers, I like to bookmark a couple of [pages that compile the best deals](https://checklist-expert.com/usa-black-friday-2018-tech-early-offers/). This is my starting point usually. Otherwise I search for the products from my wish-list.

The  real help comes from price tracking websites like camelcamelcamel and  keepa. If the deal has a real discount and it's at the all time low, I  consider buying it.

This year I was nicely surprised to find a really good deal on Gigabyte Aero. It had a $600 discount.

0,LPT: There is a big difference between an excuse and an explanation.,"I have seen this mistake made by managers and just people in general time and again.

When you confront someone about something they have done wrong, providing they tell you the truth, there will generally be 1 of 3 reactions.

1. Excuse
2. Explanation
3. Indignation

They are 3 very different responses represtenting 3 very different perspectives and yet people tend to have the same reaction to all 3.

So let's break down what each one means.

1. Excuse - I didn't do anything wrong, circumstances beyond my control caused this to happen.

2. Explanation - I made a mistake, this was my reasoning at the time.

3. Indignation - I don't perceive I did anything wrong and I am angry at you for suggesting I did.

Now all of these reactions are acceptable in different situations, the problem is many people (managers especially) only hear EXCUSE which causes them to try to convince the person what has happened IS their fault and punish them hoping they will change. If they can clearly see what they have done is wrong, acknowledge it and are already wanting to change, your punishment only serves to deteriorate your relationship with that person (likely reducing their efficiency) and inflate your ego.

It is human nature to go into an argument firing on all barrels, it is important to acknowledge when that person doesn't fire back.

Here's a simple example of each.

Kevin's car runs out of gas causing him to be late for work.

1. - EXCUSE - I was late because I ran out of gas.

2. - EXPLANATION - I should have filled up my car last night but I got distracted watching football with my friends and forgot. It won't happen again.

3. - INDIGNATION - My car ran out of gas, what do you want me to do?

Now 2 out of three of these responses would cause me to bring down the hammer of Thor rattling through these halls like a thousand winds but the explanation? It aknowledges what they did wrong and indicates they will endeavour to ensure it doesn't happen again. Obviously this behaviour has a shelf life and if someone continues to do the same thing wrong, giving the same explanation, it becomes an excuse.

Depending on the circumstance the response of ""Indignation"" can be a fantastic indicator of who the person is, if you are being reasonable and they still resign themself to indignation it is a good indicator they are working at the wrong place.

How we react in adverse situations is the best litmus test of our personality, think about how you would react being in that situation and how you react to someone else being in that situation.

The end goal is always trying to make it not happen again and having as little repercussions from it happening as possible. 

Given this framework sometimes the hammer is needed, many more times it is not.

We all make mistakes, the important thing is we acknowledge them as MISTAKES and learn from them.

All you seasoned or even amateur cooks out there, this LPT is NOT for you! This is strictly for those who never really cooked and think that cooking is not for them.

We’re in our late 30’s and only got into cooking recently. We don’t subscribe to any of the services anymore* because we can look into the fridge and just think up something based on the available ingredients. Or walk through the produce section and just pick up random stuff to cook. Maybe search for a recipe online. The confidence of knowing that you can cook something delicious without much effort is so liberating.

Most services offer new customer discounts, so you don’t have a lot of excuses. Give them a try! You won’t believe the _delicious, restaurant-quality_ dish you’re eating was made by you!

344,LPT mainly for men but can also work for woman too. must read whole thing for best results.,"Okay. So this might seem a little crazy but bear with me, I promise you it works, many of my clients have had great success around a 70% success rate.

What you got to do is, do the thing you want to do be it washing dishes, exercising more (ease your way into this one 10 minutes the first day is enough) whatever it is you don't want to do but think you should or need to.

Then that night or a little while after (best time is uncertain, more test needed) you go home and you have to visualize  yourself doing this, shut your eyes and picture yourself with your minds eye doing the task (those who struggle with visualization should practice visualizing first, this tip can't help with that. You also don't have to do the thing first you could visualize it a few times but your success rate will be lower. Then you jack it (or whack it if you're a woman but this tip unfortunately doesn't work as well for woman unless you're good at finishing), the more you do this the night after doing whatever you want to do more the higher your success rates.

This may sound crazy but I have been backed by top scientist. The logic behind this is that as you jack it or wack you're releasing dopamine the whole time but you're visualizing sometime you don't enjoy so your mind learns to associate that thing with dopamine and it being good/reward-full. 

I would suggest only getting into the habit of one thing at a time as trying to do 2 or 3 will lower success rates. You also should reach the O for that big dopamine hit, it may still work even if you don't and still get excited but results may vary. Edging also helps greatly, the more dopamine you get flowing while visualising the better. The better the visualisation the better the results also so practice that in between whacking and jacking but with something other than your desired goal or else your brain will learn that doing that thing only activates the reward circuit sometimes.

366,"LPT: Periodically Schedule Your Own Personal ""Fire Drills"" at Random on Your Phone","This is a really low effort lpt to set up and I've noticed that the very act of doing so has improved my situational awareness and discipline for the sort of rare emergency situations that periodically affect my anxiety.

STEP 1: Simply choose an arbitrary date in the future.  Ideally the first time you do this choose a time of day/ day of the week in which you roughly anticipate you won't be particularly busy, then create an event in your mobile calendar called ""FIRE DRILL"" or whatever event you're prepping for. I highly recommend setting the first one only 1-2 weeks out, but gradually spacing these periodic drills out over several months or even once a year (but always on a random day/time and without reminders) as you get comfortable with the drill.

STEP 2:  FORGET about Step 1.  Go about your life.  At some point you'll ideally want to familiarize yourself with the actual steps you're gonna take in an emergency too.  The first drill serves this purpose well.

STEP 3:  Your phone buzzes in your pocket unexpectedly.  You check it and that pesky Calendar app says ""FIRE DRILL."" This is where those discipline muscles get activated:  DON'T IGNORE THE DRILL*.  Take this time to ACTUALLY think through your checklist in the event of  an actual emergency, confirm safe exits, and generally make sure any emergency supplies, batteries, water, etc. are still where you swear you left them.

*Don't be dumb.  If you happen to be operating heavy machinery or drinking when the fire drill event triggers, best let this one go and reschedule for tomorrow.

After you run through your first drill, SCHEDULE A SECOND before you forget. For the first drill it definitely works best if you just set it for some time you're free in the next week or two so you are more likely to not find yourself busy or in airport security line or whatever, and really so you don't forget why you ever bothered to do this in the first place.

415,10 Quick Mind Hacks,"Here are 10 quick mind hacks, to help you get the most out of your life:

**1) Goals** \- To increase the chances of achieving your goals, turn them into S.M.A.R.T goals, which stands for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based. (Bonus tip - Divide your goals into three categories: short term, mid term, and long term). This article goes into more detail: [https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/setting-personal-goals.html](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/setting-personal-goals.html)

**2) Self reflection** \- Every time you want to criticise others, get into the habit of taking an honest look at yourself, and try to see if there’s anyway you can improve yourself first. Often, it’s not others actions that are bothering us; it’s really ourselves. It's also a good idea to set aside some time at the end of every day, week or month, to honestly evaluate how your life is going. Try to look for patterns of behaviours, and any improvements that can be made for the next time period. This article goes into more depth: [https://keithwebb.com/how-to-improve-with-self-reflection/](https://keithwebb.com/how-to-improve-with-self-reflection/)

**3) Effective persuasion** \- When trying to change someone else’s mind, start with common ground and what’s right about their position, before you point out how it could be better. This 350 year old ‘trick’ comes from the philosopher Blaise Pascal, and you can read more about it here: [https://qz.com/778767/to-tell-someone-theyre-wrong-first-tell-them-how-theyre-right/](https://qz.com/778767/to-tell-someone-theyre-wrong-first-tell-them-how-theyre-right/)

**4) Neuroscience of happiness** \- The latest research from the neuroscience of happiness shows there are four quick and simple things you can do to maximise your happiness: 1) Gratitude 2) Label emotions 3) Make decisions 4) Hug. So get into a habit of practicing these four things to achieve a happier life. For more on this subject, check out this article: [https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/09/make-you-happy-2/](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/09/make-you-happy-2/)

**5) Nonviolent Communication** \- Often we don’t hear what people try trying to communicate; we hear what we think they communicate. If someone is being insulting or critical, instead of focussing on what they think, try to hear the underlying feelings and needs behind the message instead.

A quote by Marshall Rosenberg summarises this idea:  “All people say is thank you (a celebration of life) and please (an opportunity to make life more wonderful)”. Once you understand that, you will find yourself becoming far less annoyed and angry with other people, and the likelihood of conflict and violence is dramatically decreased too. To learn more about Nonviolent Communication, check out this website: [http://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/learn-nonviolent-communication](http://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/learn-nonviolent-communication)

**6) Purpose** \- A purpose, or in Japanese “Ikigai”, is an incredibly important part of your life, and if you don’t have one yet I highly recommend you try to find it. A good way to discover what your purpose should be, is to find something that overlaps the following categories: 1) What you love 2) What the world needs 3) What you can be paid for 4) What you’re good at. See this article for further information: [https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7](https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7)

**7) Defence mechanisms** \- A defence mechanism is an unconscious mechanism of the mind which helps you deal with unwanted feelings and unacceptable impulses. A goal of ideal mental health is to become aware of your defence mechanisms, and replace all unhelpful and immature ones with more productive and mature ones. Here's a few examples of mature defence mechanism: acceptance, altruism, anticipation, courage, gratitude, humour, mindfulness, and sublimation. Read this wiki article for more on this subject: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence\_mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanisms)

**8) The Four agreements** \- Writer Don Miguel wrote a book called “The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom”, which highlights four principles which serve as a great foundation for building your life on: 1) Be impeccable with your word 2) Don’t take anything personally 3) Don’t make assumptions 4) Always do your best. For more on these principles, read this article: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/cui-bono/201012/agreeing-the-four-agreements](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/cui-bono/201012/agreeing-the-four-agreements)

**9) Self discipline** \- To become successful at anything you need to master self discipline. The quickest way is to reframe your “hows” to “whens”, and get into the habit of just making a start on a task, regardless of how you feel at the time. Another powerful tool is visualisation, where you try to vividly imagine the possible outcomes of your efforts and actions prior to starting any task, as an extra motivation to make you more disciplined.

**10) Growth mindset** \- Many people have a fixed mindset as they go through life, which is the assumption that much of success and talent is inborn—you either have it or you don’t. A far better approach is called a growth mindset, which assumes most of those things are learned and developed along the way. Here’s some examples to try: Instead of “i’m not good at this”, try “what am I missing”. Instead of “I’m great at this”, try “I’m on the right track”. Instead of “I give up”, try “I’ll try another strategy”. Instead of “This is too hard”, try “this may take some time and effort”.

450,Goodbye Friends,"I guess this tip is to just cherish and hold on to your friends for as long as you possibly can. Love every single moment with them before it’s too late.

High school has been really sad. Not hard, just sad. Well I guess it is pretty hard, but what sucks more is watching the years go by. I remember in middle school, my relationship with my small friend circle was the greatest thing I ever knew. We were seen as outcasts and losers, but we didn’t care. Everything was so beautiful. Flashlight tag in the field behind the house, skateboarding through the town on a hot Summer night, sleepovers, water gun fights, and getting the shit scared out of us at Bates Motel in October. It was even just the little things that matter so much to me now that it’s gone; sledding in the winter, mustering up the courage to stand up to our bullies, reveling in each other’s misery at Junior Capers, and setting up tents in the backyard. I never quite understood how much all of it meant at the time, and I guess that’s normal.

After 8th grade, I transferred districts because I hated the school, and I thought high school in my current district would be the same. My friends begged me to stay, but I convinced them that we could still be friends even if I didn’t go to the same school. I deserve a punch in the face for that. Turns out the school I transferred to wasn’t any better. I stayed there for 2 years for some reason. I think I was just so desperate to like school, and didn’t want to accept that I made a mistake by by transferring. I wasted freshman and sophomore year friendless, at a school I didn’t even know I hated. 

I transferred back to my original school district Junior Year, and I was stoked to see my friends again. I could get back together with the old group and we could enjoy the last years of our youth together....but there was no more group. Something happened during the 2 years while I was away. I don’t know if it was caused by an argument or time, but they completely split. A friendship that had been going for 13 strong years and seemed unbreakable had just vanished, and it was horrifying. I was alone, just like I was at the other school. I’m still alone this year. We talk to each other and get together occasionally, but it’s not the same. We exchange nods and glances in the hallway, but it’s empty. 

I’ve tried so many times to get the group back together, but I think it’s time to just let it go. I’m getting older now, and things change. I just wish I stayed in the district and never switched schools. Your friends are more precious to you than you could ever imagine.

People underestimate their resilience, strength, and efforts in tough times. 

Reminding them that it was not you who did everything *for* them, but that they were ultimately the active agent over their own life and you were by their side *with* them, gives them a chance to recognize their own efforts and strength whilst also letting them know they’re loved and not alone. 

We’re each ultimately only able to control ourselves and our own lives at the end of the day. To me that means that loving someone isn’t doing everything for them but supporting them in helping themselves, and reminding them of their progress and that you’re by their side.

3. Laser printers are much more value, because each toner cartridge gets *thousands* of pages of documents, and hence cost much less

4. The quality (i.e. DPI) of printed documents drastically improves with lasers

5. If you own a colour laser printer, it generally *won't* use the colour cartridges for text that's black, unlike ink jet printers which use *all four* colours to intensify the darkness of black text

514,LPT: The most effective and fastest way to get a promotion is to switch jobs.,"Here’s my story: i live in Chicago. In the Spring of 2017 I started interviewing for a promotion. I was making $65k base + $40k commission. The internal interview went well and I was notified I got the job, however they needed an opening for me. That took a year. By the time I finally got the go-ahead to move into my new position, I was notified my commission was increased to $50k (sweet!) but my base was reduced to $60k. Why? Because they can’t afford to increase my base pay right now. It would increase on merit down the road. 

That’s bullshit. I immediately started looking for new jobs. Long story short, it took 6 months to find the right one but my base increased to $85k + $50k with more responsibility/resume boosting. That has been great for the past 7 months. 

The other day, a company reached out to me and offered to interview. I said I would but the only way I would accept a new job is if the money was much more. After all, I just got a new job. They offered $110k + $110k commission.

I am not special. I have just realized that companies will pay more for something they don’t already have. In the course of 8 months, my pay has gone from $110k OTE to $220k OTE. ",LifeProTips,1540300637,WillyDreamwold,20,1,True,2018-10-23

580,"LPT: Every degree program has a unique Return on investment and you do yourself a disservice considering only 1 or 2 factors, or putting stock in anecdotes","The big 4 factors to consider
Cost of attendance
Average salary in field
Graduating Job placement %
Continued Job opportunity in field.

Other considerations:
How job will effect your health long term (looking at you trade schools)
Opportunity cost of attendance (what you give up to spend time attending school)

Elaborating:
  Cost of attendance- compare stanford to San Jose state to san jose community college not private to state to community college.

Salary- like it or not the same degree from a more rigorous program with an extensive alumni is going to get you more upfront return than one that is less prestigious in either category. The administration of a degree program should have data on graduate salary, ask for it.

Job placement- higher is better, the administration of a degree program has it, get it and factor it in a high salary low placement degree is gambling, we shouldn't gamble with our future if we can help it.

Continued opportunity- how does the average salary in the field relate to the average starting salary, is the industry growing, how high can you climb the ladder with your degree? Mostly abstract but very important.

Long term health- does your degree put you in physically strenuous situations, heat &amp; cold, literal danger, bending twisting lifting. Try to find a tradesman in his forties without knee and back pain. This is the most overlooked cost of a program.

Opportunity cost- a 12 year degree is 12 years of not yet having a career, it costs not only in tuition but also lost wages especially long term things that grow in value, real estate, retirement, other investments. Make sure you make up the cost in another category

There is no silver bullet for higher education despite what people on this sub seem to think. Sorry I know this has probably been said before but I see ""LPT: go to trade school"" or ""LPT: private college is a scam"" ""LPT: start in a comm college"" ""LPT: student loans are always bad"" and its all some angry redditors generalisation after a bad experience, or their plug to make them feel better about their decision. 

Is this protip an angry rant? Yes.

Here's why I'm posting this. Once upon a time, I met the best barber ever. I called her the hair ninja. She would barely look at my hair and I would always get the best haircut in the world. Anyway, also once upon a time, I had a girlfriend (shocker). My girlfriend asked me to cut my hair. I said ""giiiirl have a seat Ima give you the best cut of your life"". She said ""one inch off, just a trim"". Well, its kinda hard to measure an inch with a pair of scissors, so an inch turned into 5. It also looked like garbage. A week later I went in with her to get my haircut with my hair ninja, and after my haircut and after my girlfriend said I still look like a douche bag, my hair ninja wrote her phone number on a post-it-note and gave it to my girlfriend and said ""call me, I will fix your hair free of charge"". My girlfriend did not take up the offer, and left the post-it-note in the cup holder of my car. fast forward 5 months and I broke up with my girlfriend. Not important to the story, just me plugging the fact that I'm single (ladies HMU). fast forward 3 months (today), I called the barber shop to set up an appointment with hair ninja. The lady on the phone told me that hair ninja doesn't work there anymore. Heartbroken, I set up my appointment with a random woman. I thought I lost my best barber. I went to stalking Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, you name it. No @hair\_ninja to be found anywhere. Then it clicked. That post it note has been sitting in my cup holder compartment for 8 months, covered by 8 months worth of Lipton green tea bottles, and its still there. I text hair ninja, hair ninja texts me back, and all is well. 

MORAL OF THE STORY: If you mother is anything like mine, she would go yell at you for your ""mess"" and ""garbage"" and tell you to throw it away. That's what a ""clean"" person would do. And I'm not recommending being a hoarder, but if you FOR A SECOND think to yourself ""there is a slim chance that I might need this one day"", keep it. If your mother has a problem with it, that's her problem. Better to have a messy drawer of ""junk"" than to one day wish that you had said ""junk""

693,"LPT: For Retired Folks with the Prescription Plan Blues, the savings one can realize with cancelling your plan and relying on coupons is simply amazing.","I am 67, retired, on Medicare, with a Medigap Plan G Policy; which doesn't cover drugs. 

I have been researching to find the cheapest medicare approved plan using the list of prescriptions I take. The cheapest one that covered all my meds required a $16.50/month premium, and copayments totalling around $1,200 for the year. This comes to a total of  about $1,400 for the year.

Now when I run the same list of meds through a site like GoodRx, my total cost comes to around $650, using the coupons they allow one to print.

Granted, instead of getting it all from one pharmacy, I would have to get paper prescriptions for 90 day supplies, and go around to at least five different places in my vicinity once every 3 months. In balance, I consider it worth the effort.

I intend to test this strategy in 2019, and will report back.

746,LPT: Forgive your parents.,"“Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.” - Oscar Wilde

Life is a cycle and students eventually become teachers. It’s important to have healthy relationships if possible with your parents as it plays a key role in social development. I say if possible because sometimes relationships are irreparable and you shouldn’t risk fixing a relationship if it has been historically abusive.

If parents are abusive or neglectful during child rearing, the child will lack discipline and confidence. When a child is taking their first steps, they don’t need reassurance. But once the child becomes unsure, they look to their parents for permission/guidance. For healthy development, the child needs to consistently receive that support throughout their lives.

Eventually the roles switch when that child becomes an adult, because the young adult is now in the driver’s seat and power dynamic is shifting. It is at this point that children must become the parents and reciprocate the guidance and support that was given to them so that the parents can feel fulfilled in their parental duties.

It is important to forgive your parents, because if you cannot move past this stage (as with most tiered-phases in psychological and social development), the relationship cannot grow and will stagnate or worsen.",LifeProTips,1540377823,quinntessentialmedia,16,1,True,2018-10-24

When  a colleague or classmate asks you for feedback on some work or a job  application, don't give them the ""Yeah it's perfect, just submit it now""  line as that won't help them learn. Take the time to carefully read  through it and offer them some advice on anything that can be changed,  whether it's a small grammatical mistake or maybe they have a sentence  that covers three lines and need to add some commas, or maybe you feel  they've targeted the wrong audience.

Whatever  it is, they'll appreciate you constructively pointing out one tiny  mistake much more than them losing marks or missing the job opportunity  because of something you could have suggested as a change.

If however you can't spot any mistakes and you are struggling to find something to be critical about, give them some positive feedback about a specific point in their work, this shows that you did actually read it and that you do think they have done a good job. This approach is always a good idea and will likely bring the person back to you for more feedback in the future. ",LifeProTips,1540378969,Eacaw,3,1,True,2018-10-24

755,LPT: Don’t pick the university with cheaper tuition. Research and analyze your options.,"I’m writing this because I saw the other popular LPT that the rest of reddit has been parroting since forever. There’s this widespread push for choosing a school based on what gives you the least amount of debt, but it really doesn’t take everything into account.

First off, a lot of people were making fun of students from top tier universities with lots of debt, and it bothered me so much that I have to address it. If we’re talking about elite universities, Ivy league schools don’t require tuition if your family income is below 60k, and most only require a small percentage of your family income if you’re middle class. Stanford has a very similar program, with tuition being covered if your family income is under 125k. If you come from a high socioeconomic background, you can probably afford these schools anyways. To sum up everything, if you have what it takes to get in, you should definitely apply for these schools. 

Now onto my arguments for lower ranked, top 25ish private universities. Some of the arguments were addressed in the comments already, but to consolidate those reasons of why a more expensive school would be better, one should consider alumni network, resources, and the environment. The differences in networks between a state university and a high ranking private university can make a huge impact on your future. While I did dual enrollment in highschool at a local state university, basically nobody helped, and I was on my own. When I went off to my private university for freshman year, I was shocked that alumni would go so far out of their way to help students academically and career-wise. I got my first dream internship solely from pledging a fraternity and being approached by alumni.

Additionally, one should look up whether their school is a target/semi-target school. On campus recruiting is almost required to get jobs in investment banking, consulting, or other high finance careers. Some people were saying that school doesn’t matter after your first few jobs, but these areas are almost impossible to break into outside of going back for your masters at an elite university. While extremely important for business careers, it can be seen a little bit in tech as well; Google and Facebook hire an overwhelming portion of their employees from the top 10 universities. For example, look at John Legend. I’m certain he is very intelligent, but he also got into management consulting at a top firm with a degree in English. I would bet my left nut that him going to UPenn and taking part in a couple honor societies there were big factors in his employment. One should research what companies offer good compensation (salary, interest, and work life) for their desired field, and see where those companies recruit heavily from. 

Additionally, consider the people you’re going to be around at college and how they will affect you. Student organizations can be important aspects of a resume, they can give you a glimpse of what work will be like in the future, and they can provide excellent networking opportunities. The student orgs that are doing crazy innovative or impactful work are mostly at top universities. Most of it’s because they have the prestige and resources to do so, but it can also be attributed to how motivated, talented, and well connected the other students are. The people around you have an influence over your own motivation and choices. 

Another thing to consider is salary after college, and if that would allow for one to take out private loans. For example, I will have about 60k in debt after getting my undergraduate degree, but I also know I’m going to get a much higher salary with drastic increases every two years. If I had gone to a state school, I definitely wouldn’t have the same salary progression or ceiling. I may have debt coming out of uni, but I will have also paid if off in 2 years of working. 

Basically, do your research before you make a decision. Look at your potential exit opportunities, salaries, and financial aid package. You may have to take on debt, but that isn’t always necessarily a bad thing. Also be realistic with yourself. If only 4 people are hired by a competitive industry per year at a school you’re looking at, don’t put yourself in debt for that small opportunity. Gauge your own ability as well. Look at others, stalk people on linkedin, study up on school subreddits/ratemyprofessor and see what it takes to get to where you want. From my experience and others’, you might be the big fish now in highschool, but you’re moving from a small pond into the ocean. An acquaintance from high school thought he was special and could totally ace organic chem because he was ranked in the top 3 at our school. Last time I checked, he was no longer premed. You also might not be cut out for super intensive jobs. I know for a fact that I can’t work 80+ hours a week in investment banking, so I didn’t have to worry about going to a target school for that. If you’re somewhat self aware and do your research, you’ll likely come to the right decision. 

Sorry that this was super long, but I had a lot to say about the topic.
Tldr: Don’t just choose which college you’re going to based on finances. Research extensively before making a decision because there are multiple factors behind your future employment.",LifeProTips,1540382281,lolephant88,2,1,True,2018-10-24

768,How to be more approachable to women,"I used to be very toxic and blamed women for my problems, however using these simple tips, I became a better person.

First of all, you need to stop your misogynistic mindset. If you hate women, women will hate you. You just need to treat women with respect both IRL (offline) and online.

You need to be less rude to people who annoy you online. Women sense these things, they can look at you and deduce by reading your facial expressions that you're the type of person who'd tell them to fuck off when they comment on reddit to offer their point of view ""as a woman.""

You need to stop calling her male best friend a cuck and tell her he's jerking off thinking about her and she can only enjoy that fact when she's technically unaware of it, now you ruined the fun.

You must want her friendship as well. If you want to get laid you should want to be her friend. But if you want to be her friend, you shouldn't want to have sex with her, you should be happy that you can enjoy and admire the precious person she is without having any use of it. If you don't want to do that, this is why you can't get laid. If you do want that then you're good and totally deserve to get laid by some hypothetical other female some time in your future maybe.

But remember you're not entitled to it. You only deserve it if you don't think you deserve it. But why would any woman think you deserve her if you yourself don't believe that you do? Have confidence. Be dominant and go for what you want, grab them by the pussy. Well, no, don't do that.

But do approach women, if you don't approach women this is why you can't get laid. Just don't approach them because you want sex, when women know you're mainly interested in them for sex they feel objectified even though you can't possibly know much else about them at that point that would be an incentive to approach them. But that is your problem, that is why you can't get laid, because a lot of men actually do approach these women on a daily basis just because they noticed their intelligence and sense of humor from across the room.

Women are, above all, people. You need to treat them like regular people. Like you'd treat any random guy you encounter. If that means minding your own business and leaving them alone assuming that if they need something from you they'd let you know, this is why you can't get laid. How many women did you approach in your lifetime? Do you know how to talk to women? You talk to women like you talk to any other person. You impress her with your passions, ambitions and hobbies. You entertain them, make them laugh, give them compliments but also keep them interested, you have to fascinate them, show them what you have to offer, advertise yourself, display confidence, attract with your body language, take initiative, put yourself out there, prove your worth, while she looks good and giggles occasionally. You know, like any other conversation you'd have, she could easily be an unattractive dude and the script wouldn't change, right?

To attract a woman you need hobbies. It doesn't matter what they are, women just need to see you're passionate about something. Unless it's gaming, forums, passionately jerking off to porn, anime, comics... no wait, there are girls who like these thing. How will you know when you find one, no worries, she'll tell you and every other guy who encounters her She already has an army of white knights who convince her that a personality like hers is something that only occurs once per millennium, and to think it comes with those tits assures her divine status. So don't bother, she only wants to recruit you. Back to less special snowflakes, yeah, your hobbies aren't hobbies, so you need to change that and improve yourself by becoming passionate about things that don't interest you.

You should also be ambitious. Not like, ambitious to get 100,000 karma. Ambitious means rich. Don't call them gold diggers, this is why you can't get laid. It's not about money at all, it's about proving you can be a good provider and displaying passion for your work because the time you spend away from her working is really one of the most essential parts of your relationship.

Women are not asking for much. They just want to be treated like anyone else. They are your equals, they are not better or worse than you. You can treat them the way you would like to be treated by them, you can be honest with them and open with them. You can just be yourself, that's the key. You don't have to try to be someone you're not. You don't have to pretend or fake things, you don't have to play games. Just how men are different so are women and some women will think you're great for who you are, will be impressed by your interests cause they share them, will like your mindset cause they think like that too.... If this is what you hoped for, this is why you're still a virgin.",LifeProTips,1540390815,blackpiller2,1,1,True,2018-10-24

Don't do this...

&amp;#x200B;

Bears don't want to see humans and will avoid them if they hear them coming.  When walking through the woods where suspect bears to be make sure you're being loud.  Clap your hands, make yelling sounds, bang your walking sticks together, etc...  If they hear you they will likely move.

&amp;#x200B;

If they dont move and you come across one, stop, go back the way you came, wait, make more noise at a very safe distance, and carry on once they've moved.  Do not display any aggressive behavior to the bear.  You could end up pissing it off and making it aggressive in return especially if there are cubs near by, or it has nowhere to move to.

&amp;#x200B;

If you startle a bear... well you werent loud enough, you fucked up.  Again, attempt to go back the way you came.  If the bear becomes aggressive, you'll hear huffing noises, clattering of their teeth, and them swaying their lowered head back and forth.  If they charge, running isnt an option, they're faster than you.  Only now do you try (and pray) to be aggressive.  Bang your sticks, wave them around, yell, make yourself appear as large as possible to attempt to scare it off... good luck.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're being attacked... yea sure try to remember this reddit post during all the commotion... but use your backpack as protection, protect your head/neck, and other vital organs.  Hope the bear loses interest and you're not too seriously injured to get out of there.

Over the years, some of my clothes would occasionally get a musty odor to them. They were usually my denim pants, which is understandable. After a wash, they don't get dried completely or prior to the wash they got damp and sat there for a bit. It was embarrassing when I first became aware of it. Early on, I'd wear a pair of pants and put my hands in my pockets, afterward I'd become pretty aware of my hands having a faint, mildewy smell. After a few more washes, they would get worst. One time, my family went to a relatives birthday dinner. The relatives apartment was filled with people. When we arrived there, my aunt gave me a hug. Later on, she confided in me that I really smelled like mildew. I knew that I did, but hoped that no one else would notice; apparently I was wrong. Recently, three of my denim pants started to smell and I avoided wearing them. Finally having enough, I did some web searches when I found the technique that I've listed above.

28,"LPT: Instead of ghosting, send one text message saying ""I really enjoyed getting to know you, but I don't see this working out long term"". Instead of them hating you, they'll probably respect you and salvaging this relationship could benefit you in the future.","I've had people from casual relationships reach out to me in positive ways because we made sure to end the not-quite-relationship with respect for each other.  There are some really cool opportunities I would have missed if I had burned that bridge by ghosting my not-quite-ex.

""I really enjoyed getting to know you, but I don't see this working out long term"" pretty much works for all occasions.  It's simple to send and if you're that worried about them freaking out you can block them after you send the message.

It takes a very minimum amount of effort but completely changes the way this person will view you in the future.  Here are some of the ways this could benefit you in the future

1. Maybe they hear about a job you'd be perfect for and since you ended things with respect, they feel comfortable reaching out to you to refer you to the position
2. If you're ghosting because you're not looking for a relationship right now, maybe in the future you will be and this door might not be completely closed
3. Maybe they weren't feeling it either but actually have a friend who is actually a great match for you
4. That band that you two talked about is in town playing, but they can't make the show because something came up.  They think of you and offer you the tickets
5. Literally, endless other possibilities of how the connection you built with this person could be an addition to your life sometime in the future

36,"LPT: If you are getting customer service over email or chat, don't demand that the representative give their number or call you, they may not be able to","I work in a department that provides support via email and chat.  One of our biggest annoyances is customers who demand that someone call them on the phone, often refusing to give information needed to get help - ""My issue is too complicated to explain, just call me.""

There's a number of reasons why this puts stress on us and why we're going to try and keep the communication electronic.  One is a time issue.  We're expected to deal with a lot more issues peer hour than a phone rep.  A problem that can take 5 minutes to explain and walk the customer through on the phone can usually be fixed in well under half that time with an email, and we can work on multiple problems at the same time.  We don't need have you spell out your username or email, we can send you screenshots and other attachments if necessary, and if it requires escalation all the information we'll need to provide the techs is already in the messaging to cut and paste.  You're asking for special attention that is taking time away from other people with problems just as important as yours and hurting the closely monitored productivity of the person helping you, if you can get them to call you.

The main reason, however, is that a person providing online support may not be able to call you or would be extremely uncomfortable doing so.  People are often moved into the role when they have good problem solving skills but do not function well on the phone.  Some have social anxiety or other mental issues that make taking on the phone difficult.  There's also people with weak spoken English skills, speech impediments or difficult to understand voices, and even deaf employees helping people via chat and email. 

There is always a phone support number you could use if you must talk to someone, but sometimes there's hold times and some people will try to circumvent that by emailing and requesting a direct number.  In many cases, if someone is insistent that a person call them, and won't take no for an answer, you're not going to get a support person to call you imnediately, we're going to ask someone who primarily deals with complaining or irate customers to give you a call.  You'll have to wait for it, and then you'll talk to a supervisor who will attentively listen to you talk, assure you that we will do what we can to help you, and then either have a phone rep call you later or refer you back to emailing the person who was trying to help you earlier.  They're good at getting you to cooperate with the problem solvers, not problem solvers themselves. 

If you politely ask if someone can call you, if you're assigned to someone who is comfortable doing so, they might call you, especially if they know it's something that can be handled quickly on the phone and it's slow the time.  However, if they try to redirect you towards telling them in text what your problem is, the best path to getting help is to cooperate.",LifeProTips,1537441923,MelsWhitePubes,1,1,True,2018-09-20

299,LPT: PSA For women: Do NOT buy tools as gifts for your men ( until you read this),"First, my apologies if the title sounds sexist. I assure you I am not. 

This is just my life experience &amp; observations. 

Sooooo many times I've gotten some type of tool or gadget as a gift from my SO. I always smile big &amp; bright, say thaaaaank You! I give her a big hug &amp; a kiss &amp; then in my head think ""poor thing, the salesman saw her coming""  Or worse, one of my friends shows me some strange ""tool"" and says, look at this piece of crap she bought.

I'm not being mean. These are ALWAYS bought &amp; given with the best intentions. But these are the hurdles I see:

1. If your husband, boyfriend, father or brother really really want / need any type of tool, they've probably already bought it. 

2. If you ask what they want &amp; they say ""drill"" ( just for example) don't be afraid to ask ""what's a good one?"" There are soooooo many versions / models of every tool, that even though you mean well ( and think you got the best) there's always the potential for them to think it's not really as good as what they had in mind. 

3. The salesman, although very helpful, is NOT your friend. This may sound more harsh than I mean it, but very seldom have I met someone in the store who knew more about using the tool I was buying than I did. I'm in construction. I do woodworking &amp; I try to fix and/or repair my own things when ever I can. If I go to the store looking for a ""thing-a-mabobb"" or a ""watcha-mc-call it"" &amp; they take me to a ""wutzz-a-mahoozie"" I'm rather disillusioned. Now imagine my SO saying what's the best ""thing-a-majig?"" to a person who has never needed one. Any store employee WANTS to be helpful. But their ability to be helpful is based on their use of these items. So.... ( and this is where it sounds harsh without meaning to) .... Most likely, if they're working in a store, they probably don't have the productive ""hands on"" experience needed to recommend the ""best"" of whatever you're looking for, or they'd be making a living at that instead of working in a store.  ...... However, your man ( or his best friend) does! Ask one of them instead. 

4. Do NOT be fooled by holiday infomercials! Have you ever noticed right before fathers day or Christmas, they start advertising tons of ""best thing ever"" type tools? I have 3 ""automatic"" tape measures in my shop that have never ever been opened. I have multiple shelves full of multiple things that I will probably never use. If my SO comes in &amp; says "" you don't like that one"" I say .....  no, I LOOOOVE that one, I'm saving it for best! ( and she still gets a huuuuuuge hug &amp; a kiss) But in reality, she could've spent the money on socks &amp; underwear and I would've been just as happy. ( AND used them!) .... which brings me to my next point....

5...We ( men) actually like getting socks &amp; underwear. We do use them &amp; it still shows you put some thought into the gift ( even if you don't think so) we also like: gift cards for gas, coffee, .... maybe the tool store where you were heading before reading this ( just a suggestion ;-) or ....  heck... give him a gift card to your own favorite restaurant ( that he Never wanted to try LOL) at least it will get used &amp; he might find out he likes it &amp; return the gift ( ""favor"") next year. 

And my final thoughts/""advice"" ( thanks for reading this far;-) 

If you think you've found the greatest thing since sliced bread.... show him the advertisement, or infomercial and say "" that looks cool, what is It?"" 

If he says: 

""Myeh,  looks ok"" ... do not buy

""Myeh,  looks pretty Cool"" ... 30% chance buy ( but with a lot of homework &amp; a ""follow up"" on your part) 

""Wow,  I've never seen that before""  .... it's a 50/50 buy. Just do at least one more round of questions before the actual purchase &amp; wrapping. 

""Yeah, Thats cool!"" ....  70% chance of purchase

""Oh yeah, I love those! Wish I had one""  .... buy it. If he was lying, it's his own fault ( but from those words... you still get the hug &amp; a kiss;-)

""Man, I could use one of those"" .....   90% buy it

""Man, WE could use one of those"" ..... 1000% buy It!

300,LPT: Keep a spray bottle of vinegar in your shower,"* Spray the bottom half of your plastic shower curtain before you get out of the shower. It will keep the fungi from growing—the slippery biofilm that eventually adds a faint pee-smell to the air. (Ever get that, even though you know to clean under the rim of the toilet? It’s the shower curtain! Every once in a while you can spray the bottom outside of the curtain too, where it rests against the tub.)

* Hit that sponge, or the low corner where the water pools, too. I shave in the shower and the mirror clouds with water spots every few days. I hit it with a Magic Sponge and a spray of vinegar and the mirror's back to clear in a few swipes. If I’m ambitious I can use the same sponge and some vinegar to wipe down the tub: easy to do in under sixty seconds, gives me an excuse to linger under the warm water and wake up a bit, makes me feel virtuous because I’m not much of a cleaner ordinarily. And, vinegar on the sponge and in the damp corner of the shower keeps the moldy biofilm from getting started where it would otherwise tend to.

* Spritz your bitz and feetz if they’re itchy. Jock itch, athlete’s foot? Go ahead and give those microbes moving in on you a shot of something cheap, non-toxic and effective before you resort to the exotic and expensive antifungals.

I just use straight white distilled vinegar that costs about two bucks a gallon at Costco. Dilute to half-strength if you like, that seems to work too. I like having it full-strength because it's my go-to surface cleaner these days: mirrors, tables, countertops, stovetop, microwave, sink and faucets... Cheap, retro, and effective.

They are quite fun and pretty fast.

Unfortunately, there have been a number of deaths of riders over the last several months, after they have been struck by vehicles while riding. 

As a driver and a scooter rider on occasion, I have been on both ends of what I would call “the invisibility factor.” I have almost hit scooterists who have seemingly come out of nowhere (especially when turning through a crosswalk), and I have almost been hit several times while riding a scooter. The city I live in is very bicyclist-friendly to the point that I feel safe enough to ride my bike without a helmet for short rides, but I won’t touch a scooter without proper protection. 

I can’t find any data regarding dockless scooter safety, probably because the industry was created just months ago, but I would speculate that in the coming years data will indicate greater odds of serious injury per kilometer/mile traveled vs that of other transportation methods.

Last weekend I attended a good friend of mines baby shower. She had given us a registry on amazon of stuff she wanted so I bought her baby gift ahead of time and had it delivered straight to her home. I did not want to show up empty handed to the baby shower since we are food friends, so between me and my coworker we decided to make a gift basket for the new parents to be. We put a lot of thought into it because let’s be honest they probably haven’t thought much about themselves since they found out about the baby. As well as how important it is for the parents to feel okay since they are the ones who will primarily taking care of the baby. 

Inside the gift basket we added for the mom&amp;dad: soothing eye patches  (because she will be having some long nights) , a face mask, a lightly scented candle, nipple cream, nursing leaking pads, bath and body lotions, bubble bath stuff( for adults), mugs, coffee, tea, baby parenting books and a bottle of alcohol for the dad. And as fillers we used a bunch of candy. 

Let me tell you they were not expecting to receive a single item for themselves and were frankly really happy and excited for all the items and felt spoiled. They also went on how it was such a unique idea and they would have never thought to bring the parents a gift to a baby shower!

**7.** **Mental Etiquette**

The final tip of the day is mental etiquette. Other manners that you learn in order to be more attractive especially in certain situations where someone else requires some kind of help.

So physical etiquette is where you're putting someone else's comfort ahead of your comfort. mental etiquette is where putting someone else's happiness ahead of your own happiness known to be that boyfriend or that guy who's encouraging, who's kind, who helps sort out a problem if she needs help that's another aspect that women find very very attractive once again that just boils down to being a good person and being someone who's kind and helpful three most important traits in life.

6. **Learn Cooking**

okay boys the next step is also a huge life hack if you want to see ten times sexier to every single woman out there just remember this one life rule. Learn how to cook? learn cooking trust me remember that scale I spoke about that potential loyalty scale. If you cook that puts you on that hundred level on that scale that's how big a deal cooking is. There's nothing sexier than a man who cooks a guy who can cook is associated with care kindness and being able to take care of kids. Another aspect that women instinctively find very attractive boys learning how to cook is. Really not very difficult you need to know how to make something more than Maggi but you don't really need to know how to make five-star food or something like that. So, if you really want to know how to cook remember there are some beginners cooking tutorials on YouTube go and check them out. But see guys if you learn this skill your sexiness level is going to go from here to Boise.

**5.** **Having A Childlike Enthusiasm and Openness**

Next step very simple having a childlike enthusiasm and openness. You've got to remember that if you actually get into a relationship with a lady you're never gonna agree on everything all the boxes are never gonna be thick. You guys are gonna have a difference of opinions so when a girl is figuring out whether or not she finds you attractive that's something she looks out for are you open to someone else's opinions? can you agree to disagree with hope? if she tells you an opinion do you have the ability in you to process that opinion? and maybe change your mind a little bit.

If you have that ability that's something she finds very attractive but it's not just about openness to opinions it's also about openness to new experiences. Especially if there's something that she knows you don't enjoy like say, going for a movie she enjoys going for a movie you don't enjoy going for a movie but you still take that extra step and do it for her. She's gonna love you. So once in a while get out of your own comfort zone.

Don't keep your ego in the way and just do things for her with an open heart that's what you've got to remember.

I know we're all looking for some extra money, so I figured I'd share because it's so easy. You could easily do this in addition to a full time job, as a part-time job in college, etc. You take on the amount of work you want for the prices you're willing to work for.

I literally am being paid $20 or so per hour to write articles about things I'm passionate about (for me this is holistic wellness). You could sit home in your pj's, snuggle up in a blanket, blast some music, and write articles (or design graphic images, edit people's essays, etc- the options are endless). 

&amp;#x200B;

I swear I'm not affiliated with UpWork in any way and will not be rewarded if you sign up. I'm doing this as a friend helping out a friend. I've had lots of people ask me how I'm doing this, so I made a blog post about how to get your first few jobs on UpWork.

Anyway, L ended up telling anyone and everyone who would listen, including my wife and the core group of friends. 

Last week, A, told everyone she wanted to meet for coffee. Once they had all sat down, A began, “I have something to tell you...” and L BLURTS out, “You’re pregnant!?!” And A, with a sad face says, “I had a miscarriage”

Holy shit, L imploded back into her seat, and A sat there, and began to cry...

So, if there’s a lesson to be learned in all of this: If you know a secret, especially if it has to do with pregnancy, keep your fucking mouth shut.

Applicants Who Submit During Those Times Have An Improved 13% Chance Of Getting A Response.,"I came across this study that analyzed a subsample of 1,610 job applications (that were sent at random application times) to see how much time of day affects your likelihood of scoring an interview. Here’s what we found:

* The **best time to apply for a job is between 6am and 10am**. During this time, you have an **13% chance of getting an interview.**
* After that morning window, your interview odds start **falling by 10% every 30 minutes**. If you’re late, you’re going to pay dearly.
* There’s a **brief reprieve during lunchtime**, where your odds climb back up to 11% at around 12:30pm but then start falling precipitously again.
* The **single-worst time to apply for a job is after work** — if you apply at 7:30pm, you have less than a 3% chance of getting an interview. You’re fighting another clock here (the number of days a job has been posted) but, at this point, it’s better to save your email until the next morning.

277,LPT: Learning a Language? Use a spaced repetition app to learn vocabulary in much less time and greatly improve your recall ability.,"I've been doing this for a little less than two year and I'm approaching 4000 new Korean vocabulary words learned. Korean is an incredibly difficult language but I have made better progress using spaced repetition than any other method I've tried. Spaced repetition apps follow an algorithm that predicts when you are likely to forget a word and suggests you review it before that happens. Words you know well are reviewed less frequently and words you forget are suggested more often until they are in long term memory. 

The times savings and effectiveness of using spaced repetition for me was almost unbelievable. I'm on a study kick right now and **this month I've averaged learning 16 new words everyday with a recall rate of 95%.** 

I got so into this concept I created my own app to help me. It keeps track of every single review you do and creates a learning profile for each card. Cards are then reviewed according to this profile. The app keeps track of your entire study history- time studied, cards learned etc. In 2018 I've learned 1500 new words with a 92% recall rate!

Chrome will even sync your setting so this quick keyword search is available in all the Chrome installations you use.

# How to create the shortcut (a.k.a. ""custom search engine"")

1. Go to chrome://settings/searchEngines
2. The resulting page is a list of two groups of search engines: ""Default search engines"" and ""Other search engines"".  As best I can tell, there is no difference between the two groups.  Click the ""Add"" button that is to the far right of the ""Other search engines"" text.
3. Copy paste the values from the table below:
4. **Search Engine**: \[reddit yet?\]
5. **Keyword**: !reddityet
6. **URL**: javascript:location='[https://www.reddit.com/search?q=url:'%20+%20escape(location.href);%20void%200](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=url:'%20+%20escape(location.href);%20void%200)
7. Load a page.
8. Type ""!reddityet"" and press ENTER.

# Tips

* Use ALT+ENTER when invoking \[reddit yet?\] to open the search results in a new window.  ENTER (without ALT) will replace the page with the search results.
* I provided reasonable values for ""Search Engine"" and ""Keyword"", but you may opt to change these values.  The only critical (not recommended you change) value is ""URL"".  You might prefer a shorter keyword like ""!ry"".
* I recommend wrapping the names of all ""custom search engines"" you create or tweak in \[square brackets\] to force Chrome to list them first on the search engine settings page.",LifeProTips,1534948436,Tripppl,2,2,True,2018-08-22

Privates generally have no or little outside support, and have a financial incentive to spend as little time on your case as possible. PDs are also eager for trials, whereas most privates avoid them if they can, because they'd rather not spend that much time on your case and risk you racking up fees you can't afford, especially from jail. And the PDs are often going to have have more and more recent trial experience.

The only real exception to this is the most expensive tier of private attorneys for crimes commonly committed by non-poor people, like DUIs. These guys have a bunch of pre-written motions and lots of experience on that type of case, and charge enough that they don't need to take that many to be wealthy.

I forget where I read it, but someone once said that for most things, there are no ""silver bullet"" solutions to problems. Often times, the solution is just a LOT of regular ol' bullets. You should be wary of anyone who suggests they have a silver bullet solution to whatever problem you have. You can't usually avoid the work/time investment in solving a problem.

Still, people will often claim that for whatever problem you have, they have the knowledge you don't, and often times there is some product involved. I've found that extremely often, that person just so happens to be selling that product, and if they are, that the overwhelming majority of the time, the product isn't anything special or anything you actually need.\*

Seems like there's a lot of things in the ""health"" area. Diet supplements or programs, essential oils, magnets, all that crap. But I've found this simple rule of thumb applies pretty much across the board. People selling solutions will latch on to the success stories, and those are just the people who put in the work/time required and stuck it out. You never hear about the failures, which are probably 100:1.

Like most ""rules"", I have also found one exception, and that's when you're at top performance in an area, sometimes you can achieve marginal benefit from something like this, the knowledge and some product that can give you an edge. But this is extremely rare.

344,LPT: Feeling Lost? (tip for finding your way)," 

First of all, I think most of us feel this way a lot of the time. This is largely because we never stop growing and informing our view on the world, and often strive for further growth. But there are tricks you can use to get yourself back on track. It's important to remember that life is full of ups and downs and your ability to navigate those changes will be challenged often. Thankfully, from each experience we gain new tools to navigate future situations.

One tool that I've found helps me when I'm struggling with a difficult situation is understanding my core values. Everyone has different values determined by different experiences, and these values guide that person through life and dictate their world view. Finding a partner who shares similar values is (in my opinion) key to a successful relationship. That being said\*, you can't and shouldn't try to change a person's core values,\* but understanding your own can help you to find the right match or surround yourself with great friends. I did a quick search to see if anyone has advice for determining one's core values, and here are some key takeaways that I found from a piece written by a man named Scott Jeffrey.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Personal Core Values Are Important**

Values are a part of us. They highlight what we stand for and guide our behavior, providing us with a personal code of conduct.

When we honor our personal core values consistently, we experience fulfillment.

When we don’t, we are incongruent and are more likely to escape into bad habits and regress into childish behavior to uplift ourselves.

Most of us don’t know our values. We don’t understand what’s most important to us. Instead, we focus on what our society, culture, and media values.

It’s easy to speculate and idealize what you *should* value. But knowing and accepting what you value takes effort.

*Values aren’t selected; they’re discovered. We don’t choose our values. Our values reveal themselves to us.*

If you start with pre-identified examples core values, your conscious mind will evaluate which values appear “better” than others. You will select personal values that “sound good” based on your desired self-image.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Doing this exercise has helped me to identify some of my motivations, and helped me to find ways to take small steps toward making my dreams a reality. I think that values can and often do change over time with experiences, but it's helpful to know what guides your thoughts and actions in that moment. There are lots of posts about this topic on the internet so feel free to find a source that works for you. 

At 25, I have been feeling very lost as of late, generally just dissatisfied with my life and not sure where I'm going. Finding what gives me fulfillment has been a great step to getting me out of this funk, and I just hope this post helps someone who is feeling lost the way it has helped me!",LifeProTips,1534963629,soccerluvr02,1,1,True,2018-08-22

433,LPT: Don’t put your keys between your knuckles as a self-defense tactic,"As a woman who’s practiced and even taught self-defense for like 6 years, PLEASE stop spreading the bad advice of putting your keys between your knuckles with the intention of punching an attacker with them. I always cringe when I hear someone say, “Yeah, I felt scared [walking alone through a dark parking lot, or whatever], but I put my keys between my knuckles and was really vigilant, so I felt safer!”

Skin is harder than you expect. The idea that your dull keys could pierce through skin and cause such damage to an attacker that they would leave you alone is laughable at best, and dangerous at worst. Most likely what will happen is that, on impact, those keys will be forcibly pushed backward and will tear the webbing between your fingers, leaving you with a damaged hand and a lot of pain, during a moment when you’re already terrified and not thinking clearly.

There are many valid martial arts styles and sound advice—I invite other martial artists to weigh in here—but MY advice would be to remember that so long as you can move your shoulders or your hips, you can do great damage. Attacker sitting on your chest? You can buck and knee and kick and squirm from your hips. They’re on your hips? Sit up, gouge their eyes, smack their face, turn yourself away, etc. They’re pinning down both? Then they’re probably not doing much else, (unless they have an accomplice?) so take those seconds to rest and gather your thoughts so you can better attack when they start moving again.

You’re standing up? Remember there is always the eyes and groin to go after.

For the eyes, cup behind their head to prevent them from being able to jerk back, and smear your thumb up under their eyeball to either fully pop it out, or give them a seriously distracting eye pain.

For the groin (assuming your attacker is male), remember “Slap, Grab, and Twist.” Slap the palm of your hand upward into their groin, grab it, then TWIST up up up. Duck to protect your head with your other arm (for sure he’ll be trying to whack you) while you grab behind his arm or shoulder with your other hand, and hold on until he seems weak enough to where you can let go and run away.

Grabbed your hair from behind? Remember, you have control of your hips AND your shoulders. Turn your WHOLE body and duck under their grabby hand; slap, grab and twist! Or knee them, right on the outside of their knee (even been “dead-legged”? Go for that), making sure to grab the back of their shoulder AND their hand that’s grabbing your hair (on top of your head) so it’s harder for them to get away while you’re kneeing them.

They picked you up and are hauling you to their car? Pick up your legs, like you’re doing leg lifts for an ab workout. Let aaallllll that leg weight settle back into your hips, which are against their stomach/chest; you’ll instantly feel “heavier” to your attacker. (If you can’t picture this, have a partner/friend pick you up, and let them tell you the difference between how easy it is to carry you when your feet are just dangling down, versus when you pick them up.)

They’ve picked you up and they’re trying to shove you into a car? Plant your uplifted feet on either side of the door frame, and shove backwards! You’re in control of your feet; use them!

Also, before an attack ever happens, use your imagination. Seriously. Envision yourself being calm and vicious when being attacked; thinking about instantaneously switching from being your average, nice person self to suddenly the baddest, most survival-instinct-driven MOFO ever, vicious to your attacker and calmly calculating how to come out the winner every time. Picture yourself going full tilt on hitting as hard as you can.

If you’ve never hit anyone or anything before, this is crucial. You don’t want to get in a life or death situation and find yourself weak with panic and inexperience, to the point where you can’t effectively fight back!

Like I said, other martial artists will likely chime in with their own advice and critiques on best self-defense techniques, but I think pretty much all of us would agree: the “keys between your knuckles” advice needs to stop, and should be replaced with better, more practical advice. 

If you like the idea of defending yourself with something punchy, there are items specifically designed for this purpose, but please please please stop thinking that you can use your keys for this purpose. You’ll probably just get hurt :(.",LifeProTips,1534998232,hungaryforchile,0,5,True,2018-08-23

477,Starting over - dating at 40,"I’ve been debating starting to date again after a 13 year relationship that ended very badly.  But I’m seriously doubtful I can find a kind, good hearted man that isn’t bad to look ok at. I’m a single mom to a pre-verbal 6 year old child on the autism spectrum. I also work full-time.

There are a few things that are holding me back in no particular order:

1) Guilt - his father is not motivated parent so I feel I have to be supermom at all times to compensate for his limitations. 
2) I feel that with my busy schedule only online dating is possible. But I feel that men my age only want to date much younger, so just based on my age  a whole sub-set of the male population on those sites will eliminate me. And I don’t want to date 60 years old or really lower my standards.
3) I’m not sure there is a man out there that will be accepting on my son’s disability. His own father pretty much rejected us both and only now that our son has progressed a fair bit is the dad starting to be more involved. It is also dependant on whomever he is dating. 
4) Im scared: My ex was quite sneakingly abusive towards me. Putting me down about my weight but saying it’s because he cared. Lots of gaslighting and making me think our son’s disability was my fault because I wanted children and he didn’t. I was by no means perfect but I no one deserves to be treated how I was. Towards the end of the relationship I felt like I couldn’t breathe and that everything I did wasn’t good enough. But I tried and tried to save the relationship but I was the only working on it. Only time has made me realize that I wasn’t entirely to blame for our marriage ending.  I don’t know if I can handle going through that much pain again. 
5) My ex really destroyed my self-esteem. Only for the last few months, I have been able to really start seeing my worth again. That I am a great catch. That someone would be very fortunate to have me in their life. 
6) I’m finding it hard to believe in romantic love agin. My ex has moved on so easily, has had multiple relationships since we broke up. We have been apart for 2 years but the divorce was only finalized last fall. I wonder if I am one of those people that was meant to only love once and hard. 

Anyways thanks for reading.

Go into each interview with two things, the best clothes you have, and knowledge about the company. Remember it’s better to be overdressed than under dressed and nice clothes give confidence.

Stress things mentioned in the job posting, if they’re asking for someone organized, say you’re organized, even if you’re not super organized.

Following that job at the gym I received an interview at a bank, and this was the worst experience of my life.

So I recently bought a rather large used computer case (Corsair 760T) and some cooling hardware from a very heavy smoker off Gumtree (UK craigslist). As expected, everything absolutely reeks of smoke and whilst I have been able to remove some of the smell from the cooling hardware (as it is smaller and easier to clean) I have not been able to get rid of the smell from the case.

 I have tried bleach, cleaning chemicals and everything I could find around the house but have had no luck. Due to the large size of the case many of the methods involving kitty litter or absorbent rocks seem like they will be difficult to do as I would have to immerse the entire case in them.

Does anyone know of any strong chemical odor eliminators or other methods that would work for this case? The construction is painted steel and some plastic.

These people aren't really thinking about quitting their job, they are thinking about how good it would be to quit their job.

If you are lucky enough to be in a position where you are genuinely thinking about quitting you should either be applying for jobs or just actually quit.

The day you think you want a different job should be the day you get your resume in order. 

People spend years of their life in this mindset without doing anything about it, it is easier to continue doing what you are doing than risk it for something better, not only does this reduce your professional capacity, it limits your potential for happiness, the path of least resistance rarely leads to the rainbow.

Go back and click on Advanced and run as administrator. https://imgur.com/o5xEGog

A for action, R for accomplishment.","I saw the post earlier around submitting resumes as a word document vs pdf, and thought I would add one other important tip. Long story short on the other post, always submit your resume as a pdf, not a word document. 

As a hiring manager for a major corporation, a few things I would highly advise people are the following:

1) keep your resume clear and concise. Adding more is not going to get you anywhere and will actually be a deterrent. When I am hiring and post a requisition, I have to go through a ton of resumes and the best chance people have is to be clear and to the point. If you don’t do this, it passes off as someone who is trying to game the system or doesn’t have enough to put on a resume.

2) Follow the system that I call A-R, which stands for action and result. If you are thinking about entering an accomplishment and you can’t clearly articulate what the action was and the result of it, don’t put it on. It amazes me to this day how many people submit a resume with items like “managed group of 10 people” or “managed X Y and Z”. Accomplishments need to be true accomplishments you led and drove measurable improvements on such as “identified gaps in pricing model and adjusted algorithm x Y Z (action), increasing top line revenue by 6% year over year (result)”. 

3) Lastly, don’t lie. If you can’t explain what your put in a resume, that is a clear way to end up getting thrown in the do not hire pile. Especially at the better companies out there who know how to interview candidates, they will drill deep into your accomplishments to understand everything about it.

81,LPT: How to soothe an itchy bug bite (No out of the ordinary utensils/chemicals required),"If you have been bitten by a small insect such as a mosquito, midge or horsefly, it can leave a horribly itchy sore, as I'm sure most people are aware.

If you hold the head of a metal teaspoon under a hot tap for about 10 seconds then hold the heated spoon to your sore for ~5-10 seconds (do not use boiling water -
 careful not to burn yourself!), it will provide instant and lasting relief to the itchiness and the sore will be able to heal.

This works because most bugs will inject a venom (protein-based toxin) when they bite you in order to anaesthetise the surrounding area of skin. This means that that you do not notice them feeding.

The hot spoon denatures the venom within the sore by heating it above around 40 degrees celcius (approx 107 fahrenheit); the venom will be transformed into a harmless and non-irritating concoction of amino acids and be absorbed or excreted by your body. Note that this will not work on poisons (non-protein-based toxins).

Source: Have tested this on horsefly and midge bites, there are no mosquitos where I live so if anybody could test that for me then I would appreciate it!

138,LPT: Dating tips for those who are well-off,"Many people who have money know how greedy others can be. It sort of alienates you. They get jealous and think they deserve to have it, whereas you don't. Some will pretend to care about you only long enough to take from you. Money is one of the biggest game changers in relationships, for those with too much or too little. But it really doesn't have to be if you find someone that isn't selfish. These are the people you should actually spend your money on. 

Some signs to look for include: Constantly asking you for money, or to pay so they don't have to. Taking an abnormal interest in your things and not you. Seeming to want expensive gifts instead of something from the heart. Putting more emphasis on your career than theirs. Using others for short-term gains. All of this is common sense that gets lost. 

One test of loyalty involves them being unaware of your bank account. If your budget can afford it, purchase a beat-down car as well as a nicer one. Then have a run-down place to stay, in addition to your main home. Use your secret ""poor"" life to test others and see if they're up to your standards. If they decide to sever ties, show up in your flashy car and see how quickly they turn around. Show them your house and they will be devastated. 

Now in the case that someone already knows your financial situation, there's a simple test for that as well. While you're spending time with them and looking for cues to their true inner self, play off a huge monetary loss. Maybe you were robbed. Maybe the IRS shows up. You're out of money, and it will quickly show how the other person feels about you personally. 

This stuff isn't guaranteed to work. But it should be helpful in identifying people you really want to surround yourself with. Not just in romance, but associations in general. ",LifeProTips,1532299627,macaryl95,5,0,True,2018-07-22

180,LPT Buy leather shoes!,"Hey guys thought I would share this major life tip that I just discovered, to save you all some trouble.

So, ever since I was a kid I've had bad feet, and when I say bad I mean had to have surgery to Saw off part of my ankle bone becouse it had this smart idea to continue growing to the point that I could not bend my ankle more than an inch, bad. 
Also very flat arches ( I have custom made arch inserts).

My feet hurt me so much that from  8 to 15 I literally just wore hiking boots every day for the support.

I just suffered though it, I had to compromise my fabulous sense of fashion for comfort in the shoe department, wearing the nicest looking sneaker I could find. Occasionally I would find a non sneaker shoe that was semi comfortable and I would wear it a few times a week, always with achey feet at the end of the day. 

I'm currently transferring to a new college that requires dorming, so I've been on a month long shopping spree with my mom to prepare. Today we went for shoes, which is the most difficult thing shop for when you have my feet. In the past it's taken numerous shopping trips to find a decent pair of shoes, and I rarely find anything super comfortable and fashionable. 

Let me just say my family are budget shoppers and up untill 3 years ago we did our shoe shopping at Payless and Target ( do not recommend with sensitive feet ) but in the last few years we've switched to DSW.

Anyway today we went, and I was searching in the clearance section for some boots and I came across a cute pair. I tried them on and........ Oh My God. I was speachles. I was shocked. I was in love. 

These shoes literally fit my feet like a glove, like a glove for my feet. My feet were being cradled by buttery, soft, amazing leather. I had no idea they were leather at the time, I was just flabbergasted at how a pair of shoes could be so comfortable, especially for my crazy fucked up feet. I always had problems with my shoes either being too tight at the toes, but perfect everywhere else or just to loose at the toes. These shoes where perhaps the tiniest bit snug, but unlike with synthetic shoes, they allowed for a little bit of stretch so my feet could feel like they where newborn babies being coddled by a loving mother.

I'm sure that not all leather shoes are that perfect, but I really urge you to go out right now and just buy some leather shoes, you will not regret it. Just make sure to get properly sized and get good quality leather. I know it's a little more expensive, but they will last several times longer than synthetic shoes if you treat them right.  BTW the brand I got was rieker, it's a mainly European brand manufactured for comfort, but they sell in US also.

tl;dr  - I have crazy bad feet and have always had problems finding comfortable shoes, bought a pair of leather shoes and my feet are now being serenaded by heavenly cherubs.",LifeProTips,1532318330,ticktockFUCK,3,6,True,2018-07-22

I think too many people say ""man, I need to go to the gym"" and they instantly start thinking about it like they are forced to and wont enjoy it.

Any exercise at the gym is better than sitting at home.  Sure there are different workouts to hit certain goals. That being said, we are not all going to be Olympic weight lifters or bodybuilders.  Just because a trainer or workout online says you have to do exercises X Y &amp; Z does not mean you specifically do.

I find myself, even six years into weightlifting catching myself do this. I feel like I have to do a certain amount of reps or have to hit these specific exercises or the workout was a waste. ""Screw it, I am not going to do squats today...maybe Ill do leg press and hit squats next week. that will make today fun!""

its fine to change your routine for a day, or two or even three. If you are tired of doing leg press, dont..do some lunges instead. Tired of benching, throw in some push ups  or dips.  


you are only there to meet your own goals, take any easy day if you want to. Have a fun day and throw in exercises you wouldnt normally do.

307,LPT: Contact your state's Office of the Commissioner of Insurance if you find yourself fighting with an insurance company over unethical practices. These branches exist to help consumers.,"One thing I'm not sure everyone is aware of is that in the USA, every state has a specific branch of the state government called Insurance Commissioner's Office (or Office of the Commissioner of Insurance--ICO or OCI depending on the state) dedicated to the regulation of insurance companies. I wasn't aware of this division myself until I started working for one. The size of the branch differs from state to state (as each state has a different amount of insurance companies domiciled in the state), but our entire purpose is to make sure that the companies are doing what they are supposed to do.

Now, I work for the financial regulation side, which basically just means that my section is only concerned with whether or not a given insurance company has enough money to continue running for the foreseeable future, but there's also a market regulation side to every OCI which is consumer-facing that is focused on helping the consumers if it is believed that an insurance company is being shifty or violating their own policies when it comes to paying out claims.

I just feel as though people should be made aware that this is a place to go if something like this happens and you as a consumer feel like you've been fucked over. I can't speak for every state, but in Wisconsin (where we have a sizable number of domiciled insurance companies, especially given the state's population), we work hard to ensure that the consumer's needs are put first. Technically, all state regulators are supposed to be in place to ensure consumers are being kept safe from giant corporations, but your mileage may vary depending on the size of the OCI and their resources.

EDIT: I feel I have to put a disclaimer in here--obviously, these state workers are not magic; given the right legal counsel, any big corporation could definitely still walk all over us or you, but it is our job to make sure this doesn't happen, and since we also have insurance (because we are human beings), it behooves us as regulators to ensure these companies are held responsible.",LifeProTips,1532379897,ToxTiger,1,10,True,2018-07-23

331,"LPT: College isn't the only way to start a good career. Apprenticeships, Trade Schools, and Military Training can be great alternatives in today's world.","The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**To high school juniors and seniors:** 

Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**Is there any money in it?**

There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. 

That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**What are my options?**

There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.

**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. 

Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.

Regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**TL;DR**

If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""No thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying ""DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!"" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""Go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT.

Materials needed: strong dish soap, baking soda, vinegar, and a plunger.

1. Pour like half a bottle of the strongest dish soap you can find and wait about 30 seconds
2. Pour in a good bit of baking soda and vinegar
3. Let sit for around 2-3 minutes
4. Pour in boiling water until the water rests in the tub on top of the drain
5. Plunger that hole to holy hell
6. When the water has all cleared, begin at step one and repeat until drain works normally.

Here are some tips on starting:

Prepare. People who spend the week prior to starting the program looking up recipes that are elimination-diet friendly do far better than people that jump right into it.


Have the foods that you will need on hand. Know how to cook them, and prep as much as possible in advance. For example, making a large pot of rice, complete with vegetables, protein and seasonings ahead of time can help increase compliance during those times when you get hungry and have few options nearby.


Clean out your kitchen.  People aren’t particularly good with willpower. Get rid of the foods that aren’t part of your elimination phase (or hide them really well).


Keep a journal. Record symptoms, energy and mood throughout the day to help identify any patterns with food intake.  Remember, this is a self-experiment.  And every good scientist needs a lab book in which they can keep their notes and experimental details.",LifeProTips,1532421793,Throwawaylordturd,1,1,True,2018-07-24

418,"LPT: College isn't the only way to start a good career. Apprenticeships, Trade Schools, and Military Training can be great alternatives in today's world.","The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**To high school juniors and seniors:** 

Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**Is there any money in it?**

There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. 

That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**What are my options?**

There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.

**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. 

Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.

Regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**TL;DR**

If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""No thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying ""DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!"" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""Go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT.

464,"LPT: College isn't the only way to start a good career. Apprenticeships, Trade Schools, and Military Training can be great alternatives in today's world.","The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**To high school juniors and seniors:** 

Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**Is there any money in it?**

There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. 

That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**What are my options?**

There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.

**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. 

Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.

Regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**TL;DR**

If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""No thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying ""DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!"" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""Go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT.

You get Apple Store reward points, and you can sell your old iPhone for more than you'd owe if you make the equivalent payment you'd be responsible for through your carrier.","Here's what I do.

1. Buy desired iPhone with AppleCare+ from the Apple Store on release day with a promotional financing offer from Barclay.  iPhone X was 1200 + AppleCare, so close to 1500, which qualifies for 18 months 0%.
2. Make the payments that you would be required to pay to your carrier, so for me, around 55.00 a month.
3. Get the reward points from Barclay which can be cashed in for Apple Store points or iTunes points. Nearly 4,000 non-expiring points.  25.00 gift card every 2500 points.
4. Sell your iPhone when the new model comes out for as much as 80% of the price you originally paid. Historically since 2010 I am averaging about 70% return on my old iPhone.
5. Pay off the balance of your old iPhone with the sale.
6. Cancel AppleCare+ on the old iPhone for the prorated refund.
7. repeat every year.

some details. Technically, the Apple Barclay card is only supposed to be used for the promotional financing once, however, normal purchases on the card are like 23% APR.  No sane person would ever hold on to this card after using it for the promotional financing once.  So, of course, just call to cancel the card.  They'll offer you another promotional financing offer for any apple store purchase in the next 30 days.

This new promo interest rate can go on the back end of your old promo, the oldest promo will be paid first, so you can have your new phone in hand before you pay off the outstanding interest free offer. 

I buy AppleCare+ to protect myself from breaking the phone.  AppleCare+ can be refunded at the 1 year mark for half of the balance you paid, it is pro-rated based on the length of contract.  You can also use an express replacement at around 11 months of use when your battery is under 80% for a brand new refurb which will fetch more money on Swappa for the resale.

Of course, for this to work in your benefit you have to be disciplined in paying the monthly balance you'd be paying to your carrier. 

So just doing it this way, I have actually gotten MUCH more back than just buying a new phone and using it for 2 years via  carrier upgrade programs, or even the Apple iPhone Upgrade program.  Plus at least 300 dollars in Apple Store gift cards. 

I really believe this is the best way to have a new iPhone every year, it just takes a slight bit of extra work.

Here are my last few years of Swappa sales.

that's all the iPhones I've sold via Swappa, I used to just sell them on craigslist with similar results.

486,"LPT: When traveling to places with big banknotes, withdraw slightly less than a a round amount from the ATM to get a spread of notes you can use.","TL;DR: if you’re withdrawing blocks of cash while traveling, get *slightly* less than a round amount to force the ATM to give you a spread of smaller notes.

Recently I’ve been to Sri Lanka and Hungary, both of which use a pretty ‘small’ unit of currency and have some relatively big notes in circulation. 

E.g. 1 Sri Lankan Rupee = ~2/3c USD
E.g. 1 Hungarian Forint = ~1/3c USD

Because these currencies have big notes in regular circulation (e.g. 20,000HUF / ~ $70USD) they will only give you one note if you are withdrawing that amount of money—which makes it very hard to spend at most shops and street vendors. But, if you specify your amount (e.g. 19,500HUF) instead of choosing a set one, the machine will give you smaller notes that make it up (e.g. 1 x 10k, 1 x 5k, 4 x 1k, and 1 x 500).

I’m not sure if this is an issue elsewhere but where I’m from (New Zealand) ATMs will give you a mix of $20s and $50s no matter how much you withdraw—and because things cost more the notes don’t seem as big. $70USD is a lot of money in some parts of the world and very awkward to have as a single note!

538,LpT. The drugs I’ve tried so you won’t have to.,"  A lot can change in the span of two moments. Two moments could feel like an eternity between them,  or like no time passed at all.   Time was moving so slowly  I could feel each individual beat of my heart, it was meeting my chest with a mallet, and that was before the needle entered my arm. 



  Let me start off by saying I don’t condone the use of drugs. The reason I’m posting this is because I hope that reading about my experience will be enough. 

  I am 33 years old and I very rarely smoke marijuana,   but for the most part I am sober and some days are harder then others.  I’ve always had a curious mind, however my curiosities were never about intellectual information, more about feeling. 

This is a list of the money I’ve pissed. 

Weed- the first time I smoked I was 19, I don’t think I day went by that i didn’t until I was 22 or 23.  I don’t know anyone who doesn’t remember the first time they smoked. As is a common theme with most drugs, this is the first time I had the ,”it’s not working” phase, very quickly followed by extreme happiness and smile that I could not force away. Obviously the first time with most things are usually the most impacting.  When I was 22-23 I believe the weed starting getting more potent. Now, a decade later, I sometimes have the urge to smoke a little....but it always makes me paranoid. 

Shrooms- the “avatar” drug, and yes sorry, but I do mean “Avatar” as in the movie.  Myself and my two closest friends at the time ingested them with the help of double cheeseburger. In what must have been an hour of impatience, it finally kicked in. Now shrooms...fuck, I can get behind. We felt so good and laid back, absolutely nothing could break our good vibes and our connection. Now, that word is very important here, hence,  that fucking James Cameron movie.  We were connected to everything. Colors had emotions and if one of us said, “ things feel orange right now” the other two immediately knew what they meant. 
  It was a snowy Sunday night, and each giant flake danced gracefully all around us. The light, another side effect, was soft, yet igniting. As if JJ Abrams was directing the weather, every light had a flare. I’ve consumed shrooms about 5 times in my life and each trip had a special moment. 

Then there were darker days. Days where it felt like God didn’t turn on light. 

Heroin- today is not the day I get into the why’s and how’s. 
  I was sitting in kitchen. One of them held the foil and lit it for me as I sucked the fumes through a straw. Gasoline, to this day, I smell gas and I’m reminded of the drug. 
BOOM! It’s like you took 50 painkillers and someone wrapped you in comfy blanket and rocked you to the ground. Ohh, I was so relaxed my body melted. It would never feel like that again. Soon, 30 seconds later soon, I was throwing up. That’s how I spent most of the day. (To be continued)

Meth- the first drug I injected. I was 20, in a seedy motel because I had no place to stay. Just for a little clarification, I moved to Ca by myself when I was 19...post shrooms. The moment the clear bliss went into my arm I could feel it go through my entire body. This is what it would feel like to get super powers. One extremity at a time, until you are glass full. I said I felt like Superman, I felt like could fly. The scary part of it, is I almost believed it. Luckily I didn’t anything stupid. I felt extremely confidant and I HAD to talk. Had to, never have I had so much to say in my life. 

Heroin- so you shoot drugs now huh? This the thing about heroin. Even with what you’ve read about my first experience. I wanted it again. It is a many hooked handed parasite that attached itself to my veins, and every time I shot it, over the three months that did, I melted a little less and puked a little more. Sick, that’s all I felt, sick. One time I even threw up all over myself as I was making a left hand turn though an intersection.  There came a moment where I heard a voice tell me my two options. Delete their numbers and not answer calls from unrecognizable digits, or ruin your life.

 I deleted those numbers and in just three
Months of sporadic use I had nightmares for weeks, and the smell never left. 

Cocaine- hallelujah! Now where the black tar failed, let me tell you. Cocaine succeeded. Holy fuck balls did it succeed. It’s not quite the pick up of meth but boy does it feel good. Now, unlike most people, I didn’t get talkative, I became an introvert. An introvert who thought about everything, absolutely everything, and don’t talk to me because I’m enjoying just sitting here thing to myself. Unless you wanna fuck, the let’s fuck because when i first started using, man it made me horny. And all the while I was loving the high it gave me, this is the one that i needed more and more of. 

A year and half later I had spent 300 dollars a week on 2 eight balls that I no longer did with anyone else. I did it by myself. On my own, with no company. I did two eight balls in 12 hours once, and for those that don’t know, that exceeds the I’d zone. That’s 7 grams of coke in one person, in half a day. I ruined the relationship I was in, because I only
Too late did I realize my problem. She didn’t, she actually had no idea that I was getting that high, that often. I played it off well. I did it at work, I did it anywhere I was. It cost me that relationship, and many friendships. I’ll be honest. I miss it, but I know what it will do to me and those around me. That’s why I left Ca, and I moved back home for a while. I had no self control to stay away from it.  Out of everything, I never thought it would be coke to get me in its vices.

556,LPT: An easy way to start falling asleep earlier is to keep the lights off and adjust your screens to lower brightness. You'll naturally start to get drowsy earlier.,"This worked for me for sure. I always slept around 11pm but wanted to sleep earlier so I can start my day even earlier to avoid morning traffic and get to the gym before the morning crowds. My significant other also sleeps earlier than me, so I wanted to sync up with her a bit more. 

Nowadays as the sun goes down, I don't turn on any of the lights in my house. I have nightlights around so that I can navigate and not bump into things, but that's it. Due to the fact that I'm getting my masters part time, I cannot just turn off all my screens since I need to do study in the evenings. But since the room is dark, I can turn the brightness way down and also adjust the color of the display to reduce blue content in display whitepoint (this is important!). 

On the first day I did this accidentally, as i was in a state of flow coding and didn't want to get up to turn on the light as the sun gradually set. I realized that I started getting tired a lot earlier and went to bed around 10pm easily. The next day falling asleep was even easier. I can fully start my day at about 6am now which has been super productive.

559,LPT: The quickest way to cool off your car on a hot summer day,"A car is like an oven. Sun's rays go in. They heat up the car. The heat gets trapped inside. A car can be 95 degrees hotter inside than outside. The dash of your car can be 60 degrees hotter, making it basically like the burner on your oven, heating the rest of your car. So to quickly reduce the temperature in your car, do the following:

1) While you're loading into your car (especially if you're loading kids into the car) open all doors and let the heat inside out.

2) Carry a spray bottle of water.  Spritz the air inside, and any hot surfaces that won't be damaged by water. This can drop the temperature rapidly inside the car. (And it doesn't hurt to spray yourself too, to make it comfy until the car's temperature drops.) Spray bottles can be especially useful on burning hot surfaces like kid's car seats and metal and plastic bits of seat-belts. If you're not afraid of spraying your dash and damaging it, you can cool off hot surfaces in the car, so they stop radiating heat.

3) When you start driving turn the AC up to max, pushing air in from the outside, and lower all windows, to clear out the hot air from the outside. As soon as the air from the AC is cooler than the air from the outside, put the windows back up.

4) A few spritzes of water during this process can also help drop the temperature rapidly. (You'll be surprised how quickly water evaporates in a hot car. It makes a huge difference.

Through a combination of venting heat, evaporation, and AC, you can rapidly cool your car. As global warming gets worse, we're going to hotter days and more of them. Especially if you've got kids or pets, who overheat easily, a spray water bottle in the car can be a huge help in keeping your children at a reasonable temperature.",LifeProTips,1532489742,i-tell-tall-tales,8,5,True,2018-07-24

Lies. 

This year when my roommate set it up on his account, he realised the 45$ charge is split into 3 things; 25$ phone service, 15$ wifi service and 5$ router cost. So he called them and said that we never signed up for the phone plan and that we need it removed. We also returned the router given to us by them and bought a second hand 30$ one on craigslist. After a little back and forth with them on the phone, our wifi bill is now 15$ per month compared to the 45$.

Also if anyone knows whether or not I can get back the 25$ per month I spent on the phone service with spectrum can be refunded to me in any way I would really appreciate it. On the phone I clearly said to them that I only wanted wifi and nothing else.

Tl;dr Make sure you look at the listed services on any kind of bill and ask for them to remove the ones you don’t use for the next billing period. The amount of shit companies charge you for and squeeze in is unbelievable.

668,"LPT - Portable air conditioners usually have filters for the in-room vent, but lack them for the exhaust system. Clean this to keep it working well.","Hiya,

Portable air conditioners [like this one](https://trusthomesense.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/portable-air-conditioner-indianapolis.jpg) are apparently getting very popular, but all the ones I've seen so far have the same design flaw:  They have a removable and cleanable air filter that keeps the cool air flowing through your apartment clear of dust/pollen/rocks/children, but they don't have one for the air being blown out the window.

And sure, you may think that it doesn't matter if the air being blown out the window has all that stuff in it, but the problem is that your condenser will collect it.  When it does, the air flow through your condenser will slow or even stop entirely, and your AC will become an expensive noise-generator that does little to cool down your place.  Worse still, because the compressor still works, it may overwhelm the drip pan and fill it up as the condenser isn't able to evaporate all that water and send it out the window.

On all the portable ACs I've seen, you need to remove the back plate of the plastic housing to get at this grate.  Mine had a dozen screws to take out, but once I did, I had easy access to the condenser grate and could see it was thick with dust after only a few months of use.  If you're unsure, [this](https://williamshvac.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/WP88X10041-Image-1-400x400.jpg) is basically what your condenser looks like.

I cleaned it off with my vacuum cleaner, and now the AC is humming along happily again, and even getting the apartment several degrees cooler than it was before.

690,LPT: Quick word searches can make your formal writing better,"You have just finished your formal  essay, email, presentation, etc. Here are a few easy edits that will make your writing sound more professional:

ctrl+f ""get"" and ""got""- The words ""get"" and ""got"" can almost always be changed to something more specific. ""I got new car"" can be changed to ""I purchased a new car""

ctrl+f "" ' ""-  You can use apostrophes to show ownership and for other grammatical purposes, but remove contractions. Change ""can't"" to ""can not"" and ""won't"" to ""will not"".

ctrl+f ""really"" and ""very""- instead of using ""really"" and ""very"", try changing the word being modified into something more descriptive. ""I was very excited"" becomes ""I was ecstatic"". Sometimes it is better to remove the words ""really"" and ""very"" from a sentence without altering it in any other way.

ctrl+f pronouns- Go through your writing and make sure each pronoun has a clear antecedent. If you write ""John and Richard went to HR. He was reprimanded for his actions"", then it may not be 100% clear who ""he"" is.

These are just a few quick and easy things I do after I write my essays. Remember to use discretion, and do not just change things blindly. Sometimes it is perfectly fine to have the word ""really"" in a sentence, and sometimes a more descriptive or ""bigger"" word is not appropriate in a broader context.

805,[LPT Request] 16 Years Old. What do I do in Life? Help! [Serious],"Well, here's the story of my life. I grew up very shy, timid, and socially anxious.

I was heavily bullied throughout elementary and middle school and had no friends.

In middle school I tried hard to get attention, but always got picked on still and used for

cheap laughs. I grew out of that in High School and became

comfortable socially. But in Freshman year, I wanted to make

friends finally, and the only way I knew how was to hang out with the ""rebel"" kids. And

before you know it, I'm sucked into this world of Drugs, Stealing, and Lieing. Thank God

I got out of that life by the beginning of 2018. And here I am. I'm 16, and yet my whole

family (24 - 49) is constantly coming to me laying all their problems with addiction and

mental health issues for me to counsel with. 

And it has grown me as a person, and made

me stronger through helping them. But I am at the point where I am fed up with my families

shit. And now, I just want friends man. But I never made any because I hung out with the bad

crowd. And now that I dropped the bad crowd, nobody wants me. They are all too rich and too

snobby for me. And so all I'm left with to do all day is write poetry, do therapeutic writing, get

on facebook, reddit, and quora. And then have another anxious, depressing, and stressful

""counselling"" session with one of my family members (my brother is the main one right now,

trying to overcome a past heroin addiction and depression).

I never have no time for me. And when I do, I'm alone. And I hate it. As a result, I hate being

by myself; and most the times I hate myself too. For my severe acne, my body, my life situation.

 I have nothing positive in my area to do. No classes, or lessons, or programs. Just

a coffee shop where I can write out poems and my mental struggles with weed, porn, depression,

and anxiety. I live in a town where the population is 1,000, so there is not much opportunity in

life here at all. I tried getting involved in sports, but all the jocks basically didn't talk to me.

A few of them were nice enough to say a few kind words to me, but would never go as far

as to be my friend. I always wanted to pick up a guitar, and piano, but I don't have any money, or

anyone to teach me how. And what's the point if I can't even play for any friends or

anybody? I can't even read music. (I failed hard at band with trumpet).

I'm 16 and it seems like the world is just falling apart on me. No opportunity in life. My grades

are failing from when I was a loser kid (0.83 GPA). I am skinny fat and just out of shape. I've

developed this compulsive porn habit to help me release stress, I developed this energy 

dependence on caffeine, and I'm away from home right now, but I know as soon as I

come back home in a few days, I am going to go right back to smoking pot, as it is the

only thing that gives my mind a release; although I kind of hate myself for being a lazy

stoner (even if I didn't smoke pot, there isn't anything to replace it with)

I want friends man. I want big opportunity and a future in life. About the only talent I have is

making music, and writing stories, poetry, and I have great therapy / counselling skills from 

every bodies f\*\*\*\*\*\* life problems I have to deal with.

I would go out and do things I like to do. Like Basketball; but I'm so bad I just get cut every year,

even though I work harder than the best players to get better. I had friends that are getting college

scholarships for basketball, and they use to play with me to help get me better. I had the time of

my life with them, but they moved away to a bigger city nearby with more opportunity.

I got fired from my job at Subway because the Cash Register went off with this alarm, and

nobody trained me on what to do in that situation. I loved working there too, working was

fun to me. That's how boring my life is. I put out more apps, but it's almost a month and nobody

replied.

My dad refuses to get me my permit. I probably won't be able to legally drive until 18. I probably

won't even have my own car until god knows when. So I can't travel to that nearby city to see my

friends, or take classes / lessons in something and meet people. I am stuck in this small ass town

where the best thing to do is go to the coffee shop.

I use to lift weights and loved it so much. It was a passion for sure. But my dad couldn't afford the

membership anymore, so I can't even do that anymore. Wtf man, everybody in my family wants me

to deal with their adult problems, but nobody wants to help me out so that I can have a passion

or enjoy life....

Nobody even wants to drive me 30 minutes to the bigger city, so I can take some boxing classes or

any other self defense. Or play basketball with the only best friends I've ever had in my life. Or

lift weights; my passion. And I don't really feel motivated to write a book or something. I have

so much pressure on my life, that the only writing I can comfortably do is my problem / therapeutic

writing that helps me clear my head just enough to deal with life.

I am not the one to complain about life. This is not a rant or complain post.

This is me seriously wondering what the hell can I do with my life?

Somebody please help, give me some great advice.

I have no idea where to turn.

I just want to have great friends, experiment with relationships with girls, do things I'm passionate about, and do those with friends, and go places with friends. But I have none of that. And my family doesn't give a rats ass about what I want to do.

But you can bet if they need pot, alcohol, cigarettes, or food to eat out,

(or if it's my brothers, meth or heroin) they can do that.

And my dad use to bum my paychecks off of me to pay for his cigarette, alcohol, and food addiction.

I love my family. I try to support them. But I have no support. I ain't got nobody. What do I do, Reddit? I don't know, right now........life sucks and it has for awhile now. Teenage years have been the darkest, dullest, most hopeless times of my life.

840,"LPT: If you suffer from Acne (at any age) and have trouble keeping it under control, try a Yoghurt mask.","A regularly applied Yoghurt mask may be the key to finally getting your acne under control while simultaneously evening skin tone, exfoliating dead skin and reducing excess sebum from clogging pores. 

Many people suffer from Acne from their teens well into adulthood and try dozens of products to keep their skin under control - while many can help, most do not fix the underlying problem that is causing their acne. 

To do this effectively try these steps and see the rapid improvement in skin quality for yourself (preferably before bedtime);



1) Wash your face lightly with soap and water

1a) LPT to the LPT, if you’re a man who shaves, shave just prior to applying the mask. It is the best feeling ever and will sooth the inflammation from shaving! 

2) Once try and using only Plain Whole Milk Yoghurt (I find the Whole Foods brand is best) with no added fillers, flavors or sugar - Apply a dime sized amount to the palm and rub gently into the face &amp; neck until clear and evenly distributed with a light coating - no white marks or streaks should be left over on the skin. 

3) Leave the mask on for an hour and rinse with lukewarm water


That’s it! Do this every 3~ days and you will notice a huge improvement in overall skin quality, with a reduction of acne pustules. ",LifeProTips,1532625615,Oh_my_captain,12,8,True,2018-07-26

1. Pour like half a bottle of the strongest dish soap you can find and wait about 30 seconds
2. Pour in a good bit of baking soda and vinegar
3. Let sit for around 2-3 minutes
4. Pour in boiling water until the water rests in the tub on top of the drain
5. Plunger that hole to holy hell
6. When the water has all cleared, begin at step one and repeat until drain works normally.

So there you go! I know this isn't front page material, but it's a method I wish I was able to find when I first had this problem. I hope I can help someone out one day!",LifeProTips,1532654035,Xarieste,75,501,True,2018-07-26
